<h3>SCENE I.  Elsinore. A platform before the castle.</h3>



BERNARDO
<p>Who's there?</p>



FRANCISCO
<p>Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.</p>



BERNARDO
<p>Long live the king!</p>



FRANCISCO
<p>Bernardo?</p>



BERNARDO
<p>He.</p>



FRANCISCO
<p>You come most carefully upon your hour.</p>



BERNARDO
<p>'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.</p>



FRANCISCO
<p>For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,</p>
<p>And I am sick at heart.</p>



BERNARDO
<p>Have you had quiet guard?</p>



FRANCISCO
<p>Not a mouse stirring.</p>



BERNARDO
<p>Well, good night.</p>
<p>If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,</p>
<p>The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.</p>



FRANCISCO
<p>I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?</p>





HORATIO
<p>Friends to this ground.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>And liegemen to the Dane.</p>



FRANCISCO
<p>Give you good night.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>O, farewell, honest soldier:</p>
<p>Who hath relieved you?</p>



FRANCISCO
<p>Bernardo has my place.</p>
<p>Give you good night.</p>





MARCELLUS
<p>Holla! Bernardo!</p>



BERNARDO
<p>Say,</p>
<p>What, is Horatio there?</p>



HORATIO
<p>A piece of him.</p>



BERNARDO
<p>Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?</p>



BERNARDO
<p>I have seen nothing.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,</p>
<p>And will not let belief take hold of him</p>
<p>Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:</p>
<p>Therefore I have entreated him along</p>
<p>With us to watch the minutes of this night;</p>
<p>That if again this apparition come,</p>
<p>He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.</p>



BERNARDO
<p>Sit down awhile;</p>
<p>And let us once again assail your ears,</p>
<p>That are so fortified against our story</p>
<p>What we have two nights seen.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Well, sit we down,</p>
<p>And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.</p>



BERNARDO
<p>Last night of all,</p>
<p>When yond same star that's westward from the pole</p>
<p>Had made his course to illume that part of heaven</p>
<p>Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,</p>
<p>The bell then beating one,--</p>





MARCELLUS
<p>Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!</p>



BERNARDO
<p>In the same figure, like the king that's dead.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.</p>



BERNARDO
<p>Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.</p>



BERNARDO
<p>It would be spoke to.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>Question it, Horatio.</p>



HORATIO
<p>What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,</p>
<p>Together with that fair and warlike form</p>
<p>In which the majesty of buried Denmark</p>
<p>Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>It is offended.</p>



BERNARDO
<p>See, it stalks away!</p>



HORATIO
<p>Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!</p>





MARCELLUS
<p>'Tis gone, and will not answer.</p>



BERNARDO
<p>How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:</p>
<p>Is not this something more than fantasy?</p>
<p>What think you on't?</p>



HORATIO
<p>Before my God, I might not this believe</p>
<p>Without the sensible and true avouch</p>
<p>Of mine own eyes.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>Is it not like the king?</p>



HORATIO
<p>As thou art to thyself:</p>
<p>Such was the very armour he had on</p>
<p>When he the ambitious Norway combated;</p>
<p>So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,</p>
<p>He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</p>
<p>'Tis strange.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,</p>
<p>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</p>



HORATIO
<p>In what particular thought to work I know not;</p>
<p>But in the gross and scope of my opinion,</p>
<p>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</p>
<p>Why this same strict and most observant watch</p>
<p>So nightly toils the subject of the land,</p>
<p>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,</p>
<p>And foreign mart for implements of war;</p>
<p>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</p>
<p>Does not divide the Sunday from the week;</p>
<p>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste</p>
<p>Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:</p>
<p>Who is't that can inform me?</p>



HORATIO
<p>That can I;</p>
<p>At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,</p>
<p>Whose image even but now appear'd to us,</p>
<p>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</p>
<p>Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,</p>
<p>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--</p>
<p>For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--</p>
<p>Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,</p>
<p>Well ratified by law and heraldry,</p>
<p>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands</p>
<p>Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:</p>
<p>Against the which, a moiety competent</p>
<p>Was gaged by our king; which had return'd</p>
<p>To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</p>
<p>Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,</p>
<p>And carriage of the article design'd,</p>
<p>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</p>
<p>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</p>
<p>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</p>
<p>Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,</p>
<p>For food and diet, to some enterprise</p>
<p>That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--</p>
<p>As it doth well appear unto our state--</p>
<p>But to recover of us, by strong hand</p>
<p>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</p>
<p>So by his father lost: and this, I take it,</p>
<p>Is the main motive of our preparations,</p>
<p>The source of this our watch and the chief head</p>
<p>Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</p>



BERNARDO
<p>I think it be no other but e'en so:</p>
<p>Well may it sort that this portentous figure</p>
<p>Comes armed through our watch; so like the king</p>
<p>That was and is the question of these wars.</p>



HORATIO
<p>A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.</p>
<p>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</p>
<p>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</p>
<p>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</p>
<p>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:</p>
<p>As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,</p>
<p>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</p>
<p>Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands</p>
<p>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:</p>
<p>And even the like precurse of fierce events,</p>
<p>As harbingers preceding still the fates</p>
<p>And prologue to the omen coming on,</p>
<p>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated</p>
<p>Unto our climatures and countrymen.--</p>
<p>But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!</p>

<p>I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!</p>
<p>If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,</p>
<p>Speak to me:</p>
<p>If there be any good thing to be done,</p>
<p>That may to thee do ease and grace to me,</p>
<p>Speak to me:</p>

<p>If thou art privy to thy country's fate,</p>
<p>Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!</p>
<p>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life</p>
<p>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,</p>
<p>For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,</p>
<p>Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>Shall I strike at it with my partisan?</p>



HORATIO
<p>Do, if it will not stand.</p>



BERNARDO
<p>'Tis here!</p>



HORATIO
<p>'Tis here!</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>'Tis gone!</p>

<p>We do it wrong, being so majestical,</p>
<p>To offer it the show of violence;</p>
<p>For it is, as the air, invulnerable,</p>
<p>And our vain blows malicious mockery.</p>



BERNARDO
<p>It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</p>



HORATIO
<p>And then it started like a guilty thing</p>
<p>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,</p>
<p>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</p>
<p>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat</p>
<p>Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,</p>
<p>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</p>
<p>The extravagant and erring spirit hies</p>
<p>To his confine: and of the truth herein</p>
<p>This present object made probation.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</p>
<p>Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes</p>
<p>Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,</p>
<p>The bird of dawning singeth all night long:</p>
<p>And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;</p>
<p>The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,</p>
<p>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</p>
<p>So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.</p>



HORATIO
<p>So have I heard and do in part believe it.</p>
<p>But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,</p>
<p>Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:</p>
<p>Break we our watch up; and by my advice,</p>
<p>Let us impart what we have seen to-night</p>
<p>Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,</p>
<p>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.</p>
<p>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,</p>
<p>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know</p>
<p>Where we shall find him most conveniently.</p>





<h3>SCENE II.  A room of state in the castle.</h3>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death</p>
<p>The memory be green, and that it us befitted</p>
<p>To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom</p>
<p>To be contracted in one brow of woe,</p>
<p>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature</p>
<p>That we with wisest sorrow think on him,</p>
<p>Together with remembrance of ourselves.</p>
<p>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,</p>
<p>The imperial jointress to this warlike state,</p>
<p>Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--</p>
<p>With an auspicious and a dropping eye,</p>
<p>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,</p>
<p>In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--</p>
<p>Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd</p>
<p>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</p>
<p>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</p>
<p>Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,</p>
<p>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,</p>
<p>Or thinking by our late dear brother's death</p>
<p>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</p>
<p>Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,</p>
<p>He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,</p>
<p>Importing the surrender of those lands</p>
<p>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,</p>
<p>To our most valiant brother. So much for him.</p>
<p>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:</p>
<p>Thus much the business is: we have here writ</p>
<p>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--</p>
<p>Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears</p>
<p>Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress</p>
<p>His further gait herein; in that the levies,</p>
<p>The lists and full proportions, are all made</p>
<p>Out of his subject: and we here dispatch</p>
<p>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,</p>
<p>For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;</p>
<p>Giving to you no further personal power</p>
<p>To business with the king, more than the scope</p>
<p>Of these delated articles allow.</p>
<p>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.</p>



CORNELIUS
VOLTIMAND
<p>In that and all things will we show our duty.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.</p>

<p>And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?</p>
<p>You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?</p>
<p>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,</p>
<p>And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,</p>
<p>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?</p>
<p>The head is not more native to the heart,</p>
<p>The hand more instrumental to the mouth,</p>
<p>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.</p>
<p>What wouldst thou have, Laertes?</p>



LAERTES
<p>My dread lord,</p>
<p>Your leave and favour to return to France;</p>
<p>From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,</p>
<p>To show my duty in your coronation,</p>
<p>Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,</p>
<p>My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France</p>
<p>And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave</p>
<p>By laboursome petition, and at last</p>
<p>Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:</p>
<p>I do beseech you, give him leave to go.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,</p>
<p>And thy best graces spend it at thy will!</p>
<p>But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--</p>



HAMLET
<p>Aside  A little more than kin, and less than kind.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>How is it that the clouds still hang on you?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,</p>
<p>And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.</p>
<p>Do not for ever with thy vailed lids</p>
<p>Seek for thy noble father in the dust:</p>
<p>Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,</p>
<p>Passing through nature to eternity.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Ay, madam, it is common.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>If it be,</p>
<p>Why seems it so particular with thee?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'</p>
<p>'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,</p>
<p>Nor customary suits of solemn black,</p>
<p>Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,</p>
<p>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,</p>
<p>Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,</p>
<p>Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,</p>
<p>That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,</p>
<p>For they are actions that a man might play:</p>
<p>But I have that within which passeth show;</p>
<p>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</p>
<p>To give these mourning duties to your father:</p>
<p>But, you must know, your father lost a father;</p>
<p>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</p>
<p>In filial obligation for some term</p>
<p>To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever</p>
<p>In obstinate condolement is a course</p>
<p>Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;</p>
<p>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</p>
<p>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,</p>
<p>An understanding simple and unschool'd:</p>
<p>For what we know must be and is as common</p>
<p>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</p>
<p>Why should we in our peevish opposition</p>
<p>Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,</p>
<p>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</p>
<p>To reason most absurd: whose common theme</p>
<p>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</p>
<p>From the first corse till he that died to-day,</p>
<p>'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth</p>
<p>This unprevailing woe, and think of us</p>
<p>As of a father: for let the world take note,</p>
<p>You are the most immediate to our throne;</p>
<p>And with no less nobility of love</p>
<p>Than that which dearest father bears his son,</p>
<p>Do I impart toward you. For your intent</p>
<p>In going back to school in Wittenberg,</p>
<p>It is most retrograde to our desire:</p>
<p>And we beseech you, bend you to remain</p>
<p>Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,</p>
<p>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:</p>
<p>I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I shall in all my best obey you, madam.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:</p>
<p>Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;</p>
<p>This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet</p>
<p>Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,</p>
<p>No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,</p>
<p>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,</p>
<p>And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,</p>
<p>Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.</p>





HAMLET
<p>O, that this too too solid flesh would melt</p>
<p>Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!</p>
<p>Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd</p>
<p>His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!</p>
<p>How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,</p>
<p>Seem to me all the uses of this world!</p>
<p>Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,</p>
<p>That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature</p>
<p>Possess it merely. That it should come to this!</p>
<p>But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:</p>
<p>So excellent a king; that was, to this,</p>
<p>Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother</p>
<p>That he might not beteem the winds of heaven</p>
<p>Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!</p>
<p>Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,</p>
<p>As if increase of appetite had grown</p>
<p>By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--</p>
<p>Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--</p>
<p>A little month, or ere those shoes were old</p>
<p>With which she follow'd my poor father's body,</p>
<p>Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--</p>
<p>O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,</p>
<p>Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,</p>
<p>My father's brother, but no more like my father</p>
<p>Than I to Hercules: within a month:</p>
<p>Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears</p>
<p>Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,</p>
<p>She married. O, most wicked speed, to post</p>
<p>With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!</p>
<p>It is not nor it cannot come to good:</p>
<p>But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.</p>





HORATIO
<p>Hail to your lordship!</p>



HAMLET
<p>I am glad to see you well:</p>
<p>Horatio,--or I do forget myself.</p>



HORATIO
<p>The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:</p>
<p>And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>My good lord--</p>



HAMLET
<p>I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.</p>
<p>But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?</p>



HORATIO
<p>A truant disposition, good my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I would not hear your enemy say so,</p>
<p>Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,</p>
<p>To make it truster of your own report</p>
<p>Against yourself: I know you are no truant.</p>
<p>But what is your affair in Elsinore?</p>
<p>We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.</p>



HORATIO
<p>My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;</p>
<p>I think it was to see my mother's wedding.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats</p>
<p>Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.</p>
<p>Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven</p>
<p>Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!</p>
<p>My father!--methinks I see my father.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Where, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>In my mind's eye, Horatio.</p>



HORATIO
<p>I saw him once; he was a goodly king.</p>



HAMLET
<p>He was a man, take him for all in all,</p>
<p>I shall not look upon his like again.</p>



HORATIO
<p>My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Saw? who?</p>



HORATIO
<p>My lord, the king your father.</p>



HAMLET
<p>The king my father!</p>



HORATIO
<p>Season your admiration for awhile</p>
<p>With an attent ear, till I may deliver,</p>
<p>Upon the witness of these gentlemen,</p>
<p>This marvel to you.</p>



HAMLET
<p>For God's love, let me hear.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Two nights together had these gentlemen,</p>
<p>Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,</p>
<p>In the dead vast and middle of the night,</p>
<p>Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,</p>
<p>Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,</p>
<p>Appears before them, and with solemn march</p>
<p>Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd</p>
<p>By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,</p>
<p>Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled</p>
<p>Almost to jelly with the act of fear,</p>
<p>Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me</p>
<p>In dreadful secrecy impart they did;</p>
<p>And I with them the third night kept the watch;</p>
<p>Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,</p>
<p>Form of the thing, each word made true and good,</p>
<p>The apparition comes: I knew your father;</p>
<p>These hands are not more like.</p>



HAMLET
<p>But where was this?</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Did you not speak to it?</p>



HORATIO
<p>My lord, I did;</p>
<p>But answer made it none: yet once methought</p>
<p>It lifted up its head and did address</p>
<p>Itself to motion, like as it would speak;</p>
<p>But even then the morning cock crew loud,</p>
<p>And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,</p>
<p>And vanish'd from our sight.</p>



HAMLET
<p>'Tis very strange.</p>



HORATIO
<p>As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;</p>
<p>And we did think it writ down in our duty</p>
<p>To let you know of it.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.</p>
<p>Hold you the watch to-night?</p>



MARCELLUS
BERNARDO
<p>We do, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Arm'd, say you?</p>



MARCELLUS
BERNARDO
<p>Arm'd, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>From top to toe?</p>



MARCELLUS
BERNARDO
<p>My lord, from head to foot.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Then saw you not his face?</p>



HORATIO
<p>O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.</p>



HAMLET
<p>What, look'd he frowningly?</p>



HORATIO
<p>A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Pale or red?</p>



HORATIO
<p>Nay, very pale.</p>



HAMLET
<p>And fix'd his eyes upon you?</p>



HORATIO
<p>Most constantly.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I would I had been there.</p>



HORATIO
<p>It would have much amazed you.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?</p>



HORATIO
<p>While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.</p>



MARCELLUS
BERNARDO
<p>Longer, longer.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Not when I saw't.</p>



HAMLET
<p>His beard was grizzled--no?</p>



HORATIO
<p>It was, as I have seen it in his life,</p>
<p>A sable silver'd.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I will watch to-night;</p>
<p>Perchance 'twill walk again.</p>



HORATIO
<p>I warrant it will.</p>



HAMLET
<p>If it assume my noble father's person,</p>
<p>I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape</p>
<p>And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,</p>
<p>If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,</p>
<p>Let it be tenable in your silence still;</p>
<p>And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,</p>
<p>Give it an understanding, but no tongue:</p>
<p>I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:</p>
<p>Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,</p>
<p>I'll visit you.</p>



All
<p>Our duty to your honour.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.</p>

<p>My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;</p>
<p>I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!</p>
<p>Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,</p>
<p>Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.</p>





<h3>SCENE III.  A room in Polonius' house.</h3>



LAERTES
<p>My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:</p>
<p>And, sister, as the winds give benefit</p>
<p>And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,</p>
<p>But let me hear from you.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Do you doubt that?</p>



LAERTES
<p>For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,</p>
<p>Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,</p>
<p>A violet in the youth of primy nature,</p>
<p>Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,</p>
<p>The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>No more but so?</p>



LAERTES
<p>Think it no more;</p>
<p>For nature, crescent, does not grow alone</p>
<p>In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,</p>
<p>The inward service of the mind and soul</p>
<p>Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,</p>
<p>And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</p>
<p>The virtue of his will: but you must fear,</p>
<p>His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;</p>
<p>For he himself is subject to his birth:</p>
<p>He may not, as unvalued persons do,</p>
<p>Carve for himself; for on his choice depends</p>
<p>The safety and health of this whole state;</p>
<p>And therefore must his choice be circumscribed</p>
<p>Unto the voice and yielding of that body</p>
<p>Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</p>
<p>It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</p>
<p>As he in his particular act and place</p>
<p>May give his saying deed; which is no further</p>
<p>Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</p>
<p>Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,</p>
<p>If with too credent ear you list his songs,</p>
<p>Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open</p>
<p>To his unmaster'd importunity.</p>
<p>Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,</p>
<p>And keep you in the rear of your affection,</p>
<p>Out of the shot and danger of desire.</p>
<p>The chariest maid is prodigal enough,</p>
<p>If she unmask her beauty to the moon:</p>
<p>Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:</p>
<p>The canker galls the infants of the spring,</p>
<p>Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,</p>
<p>And in the morn and liquid dew of youth</p>
<p>Contagious blastments are most imminent.</p>
<p>Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:</p>
<p>Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,</p>
<p>As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,</p>
<p>Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,</p>
<p>Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;</p>
<p>Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,</p>
<p>Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,</p>
<p>And recks not his own rede.</p>



LAERTES
<p>O, fear me not.</p>
<p>I stay too long: but here my father comes.</p>

<p>A double blessing is a double grace,</p>
<p>Occasion smiles upon a second leave.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!</p>
<p>The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,</p>
<p>And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!</p>
<p>And these few precepts in thy memory</p>
<p>See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,</p>
<p>Nor any unproportioned thought his act.</p>
<p>Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.</p>
<p>Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,</p>
<p>Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;</p>
<p>But do not dull thy palm with entertainment</p>
<p>Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware</p>
<p>Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,</p>
<p>Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.</p>
<p>Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;</p>
<p>Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.</p>
<p>Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</p>
<p>But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;</p>
<p>For the apparel oft proclaims the man,</p>
<p>And they in France of the best rank and station</p>
<p>Are of a most select and generous chief in that.</p>
<p>Neither a borrower nor a lender be;</p>
<p>For loan oft loses both itself and friend,</p>
<p>And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.</p>
<p>This above all: to thine ownself be true,</p>
<p>And it must follow, as the night the day,</p>
<p>Thou canst not then be false to any man.</p>
<p>Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!</p>



LAERTES
<p>Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>The time invites you; go; your servants tend.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well</p>
<p>What I have said to you.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>'Tis in my memory lock'd,</p>
<p>And you yourself shall keep the key of it.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Farewell.</p>





LORD POLONIUS
<p>What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Marry, well bethought:</p>
<p>'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late</p>
<p>Given private time to you; and you yourself</p>
<p>Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:</p>
<p>If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,</p>
<p>And that in way of caution, I must tell you,</p>
<p>You do not understand yourself so clearly</p>
<p>As it behoves my daughter and your honour.</p>
<p>What is between you? give me up the truth.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders</p>
<p>Of his affection to me.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,</p>
<p>Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.</p>
<p>Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>I do not know, my lord, what I should think.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;</p>
<p>That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,</p>
<p>Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;</p>
<p>Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,</p>
<p>Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>My lord, he hath importuned me with love</p>
<p>In honourable fashion.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,</p>
<p>With almost all the holy vows of heaven.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,</p>
<p>When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul</p>
<p>Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,</p>
<p>Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,</p>
<p>Even in their promise, as it is a-making,</p>
<p>You must not take for fire. From this time</p>
<p>Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;</p>
<p>Set your entreatments at a higher rate</p>
<p>Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,</p>
<p>Believe so much in him, that he is young</p>
<p>And with a larger tether may he walk</p>
<p>Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,</p>
<p>Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,</p>
<p>Not of that dye which their investments show,</p>
<p>But mere implorators of unholy suits,</p>
<p>Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,</p>
<p>The better to beguile. This is for all:</p>
<p>I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,</p>
<p>Have you so slander any moment leisure,</p>
<p>As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.</p>
<p>Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>I shall obey, my lord.</p>





<h3>SCENE IV.  The platform.</h3>



HAMLET
<p>The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.</p>



HORATIO
<p>It is a nipping and an eager air.</p>



HAMLET
<p>What hour now?</p>



HORATIO
<p>I think it lacks of twelve.</p>



HAMLET
<p>No, it is struck.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season</p>
<p>Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.</p>

<p>What does this mean, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,</p>
<p>Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;</p>
<p>And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,</p>
<p>The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out</p>
<p>The triumph of his pledge.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Is it a custom?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Ay, marry, is't:</p>
<p>But to my mind, though I am native here</p>
<p>And to the manner born, it is a custom</p>
<p>More honour'd in the breach than the observance.</p>
<p>This heavy-headed revel east and west</p>
<p>Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:</p>
<p>They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase</p>
<p>Soil our addition; and indeed it takes</p>
<p>From our achievements, though perform'd at height,</p>
<p>The pith and marrow of our attribute.</p>
<p>So, oft it chances in particular men,</p>
<p>That for some vicious mole of nature in them,</p>
<p>As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,</p>
<p>Since nature cannot choose his origin--</p>
<p>By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,</p>
<p>Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,</p>
<p>Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens</p>
<p>The form of plausive manners, that these men,</p>
<p>Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,</p>
<p>Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--</p>
<p>Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,</p>
<p>As infinite as man may undergo--</p>
<p>Shall in the general censure take corruption</p>
<p>From that particular fault: the dram of eale</p>
<p>Doth all the noble substance of a doubt</p>
<p>To his own scandal.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Look, my lord, it comes!</p>





HAMLET
<p>Angels and ministers of grace defend us!</p>
<p>Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,</p>
<p>Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,</p>
<p>Be thy intents wicked or charitable,</p>
<p>Thou comest in such a questionable shape</p>
<p>That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,</p>
<p>King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!</p>
<p>Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell</p>
<p>Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,</p>
<p>Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,</p>
<p>Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,</p>
<p>Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,</p>
<p>To cast thee up again. What may this mean,</p>
<p>That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel</p>
<p>Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,</p>
<p>Making night hideous; and we fools of nature</p>
<p>So horridly to shake our disposition</p>
<p>With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?</p>
<p>Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?</p>





HORATIO
<p>It beckons you to go away with it,</p>
<p>As if it some impartment did desire</p>
<p>To you alone.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>Look, with what courteous action</p>
<p>It waves you to a more removed ground:</p>
<p>But do not go with it.</p>



HORATIO
<p>No, by no means.</p>



HAMLET
<p>It will not speak; then I will follow it.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Do not, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Why, what should be the fear?</p>
<p>I do not set my life in a pin's fee;</p>
<p>And for my soul, what can it do to that,</p>
<p>Being a thing immortal as itself?</p>
<p>It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.</p>



HORATIO
<p>What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,</p>
<p>Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff</p>
<p>That beetles o'er his base into the sea,</p>
<p>And there assume some other horrible form,</p>
<p>Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason</p>
<p>And draw you into madness? think of it:</p>
<p>The very place puts toys of desperation,</p>
<p>Without more motive, into every brain</p>
<p>That looks so many fathoms to the sea</p>
<p>And hears it roar beneath.</p>



HAMLET
<p>It waves me still.</p>
<p>Go on; I'll follow thee.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>You shall not go, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Hold off your hands.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Be ruled; you shall not go.</p>



HAMLET
<p>My fate cries out,</p>
<p>And makes each petty artery in this body</p>
<p>As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.</p>
<p>Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.</p>
<p>By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!</p>
<p>I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.</p>





HORATIO
<p>He waxes desperate with imagination.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Have after. To what issue will this come?</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Heaven will direct it.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>Nay, let's follow him.</p>





<h3>SCENE V.  Another part of the platform.</h3>



HAMLET
<p>Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.</p>



Ghost
<p>Mark me.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I will.</p>



Ghost
<p>My hour is almost come,</p>
<p>When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames</p>
<p>Must render up myself.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Alas, poor ghost!</p>



Ghost
<p>Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing</p>
<p>To what I shall unfold.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Speak; I am bound to hear.</p>



Ghost
<p>So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.</p>



HAMLET
<p>What?</p>



Ghost
<p>I am thy father's spirit,</p>
<p>Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,</p>
<p>And for the day confined to fast in fires,</p>
<p>Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature</p>
<p>Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid</p>
<p>To tell the secrets of my prison-house,</p>
<p>I could a tale unfold whose lightest word</p>
<p>Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,</p>
<p>Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,</p>
<p>Thy knotted and combined locks to part</p>
<p>And each particular hair to stand on end,</p>
<p>Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:</p>
<p>But this eternal blazon must not be</p>
<p>To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!</p>
<p>If thou didst ever thy dear father love--</p>



HAMLET
<p>O God!</p>



Ghost
<p>Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Murder!</p>



Ghost
<p>Murder most foul, as in the best it is;</p>
<p>But this most foul, strange and unnatural.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift</p>
<p>As meditation or the thoughts of love,</p>
<p>May sweep to my revenge.</p>



Ghost
<p>I find thee apt;</p>
<p>And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed</p>
<p>That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,</p>
<p>Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:</p>
<p>'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,</p>
<p>A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark</p>
<p>Is by a forged process of my death</p>
<p>Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,</p>
<p>The serpent that did sting thy father's life</p>
<p>Now wears his crown.</p>



HAMLET
<p>O my prophetic soul! My uncle!</p>



Ghost
<p>Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,</p>
<p>With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--</p>
<p>O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power</p>
<p>So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust</p>
<p>The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:</p>
<p>O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!</p>
<p>From me, whose love was of that dignity</p>
<p>That it went hand in hand even with the vow</p>
<p>I made to her in marriage, and to decline</p>
<p>Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor</p>
<p>To those of mine!</p>
<p>But virtue, as it never will be moved,</p>
<p>Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,</p>
<p>So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,</p>
<p>Will sate itself in a celestial bed,</p>
<p>And prey on garbage.</p>
<p>But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;</p>
<p>Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,</p>
<p>My custom always of the afternoon,</p>
<p>Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,</p>
<p>With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,</p>
<p>And in the porches of my ears did pour</p>
<p>The leperous distilment; whose effect</p>
<p>Holds such an enmity with blood of man</p>
<p>That swift as quicksilver it courses through</p>
<p>The natural gates and alleys of the body,</p>
<p>And with a sudden vigour doth posset</p>
<p>And curd, like eager droppings into milk,</p>
<p>The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;</p>
<p>And a most instant tetter bark'd about,</p>
<p>Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,</p>
<p>All my smooth body.</p>
<p>Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand</p>
<p>Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:</p>
<p>Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,</p>
<p>Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,</p>
<p>No reckoning made, but sent to my account</p>
<p>With all my imperfections on my head:</p>
<p>O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!</p>
<p>If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;</p>
<p>Let not the royal bed of Denmark be</p>
<p>A couch for luxury and damned incest.</p>
<p>But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,</p>
<p>Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive</p>
<p>Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven</p>
<p>And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,</p>
<p>To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!</p>
<p>The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,</p>
<p>And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:</p>
<p>Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.</p>





HAMLET
<p>O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?</p>
<p>And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;</p>
<p>And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,</p>
<p>But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!</p>
<p>Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat</p>
<p>In this distracted globe. Remember thee!</p>
<p>Yea, from the table of my memory</p>
<p>I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,</p>
<p>All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,</p>
<p>That youth and observation copied there;</p>
<p>And thy commandment all alone shall live</p>
<p>Within the book and volume of my brain,</p>
<p>Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!</p>
<p>O most pernicious woman!</p>
<p>O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!</p>
<p>My tables,--meet it is I set it down,</p>
<p>That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;</p>
<p>At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:</p>

<p>So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;</p>
<p>It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'</p>
<p>I have sworn 't.</p>



MARCELLUS
HORATIO
<p>Within  My lord, my lord,--</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>Within Lord Hamlet,--</p>



HORATIO
<p>Within Heaven secure him!</p>



HAMLET
<p>So be it!</p>



HORATIO
<p>Within  Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!</p>



HAMLET
<p>Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.</p>





MARCELLUS
<p>How is't, my noble lord?</p>



HORATIO
<p>What news, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>O, wonderful!</p>



HORATIO
<p>Good my lord, tell it.</p>



HAMLET
<p>No; you'll reveal it.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Not I, my lord, by heaven.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>Nor I, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?</p>
<p>But you'll be secret?</p>



HORATIO
MARCELLUS
<p>Ay, by heaven, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark</p>
<p>But he's an arrant knave.</p>



HORATIO
<p>There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave</p>
<p>To tell us this.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Why, right; you are i' the right;</p>
<p>And so, without more circumstance at all,</p>
<p>I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:</p>
<p>You, as your business and desire shall point you;</p>
<p>For every man has business and desire,</p>
<p>Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,</p>
<p>Look you, I'll go pray.</p>



HORATIO
<p>These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;</p>
<p>Yes, 'faith heartily.</p>



HORATIO
<p>There's no offence, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,</p>
<p>And much offence too. Touching this vision here,</p>
<p>It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:</p>
<p>For your desire to know what is between us,</p>
<p>O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,</p>
<p>As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,</p>
<p>Give me one poor request.</p>



HORATIO
<p>What is't, my lord? we will.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Never make known what you have seen to-night.</p>



HORATIO
MARCELLUS
<p>My lord, we will not.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Nay, but swear't.</p>



HORATIO
<p>In faith,</p>
<p>My lord, not I.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>Nor I, my lord, in faith.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Upon my sword.</p>



MARCELLUS
<p>We have sworn, my lord, already.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.</p>



Ghost
<p>Beneath  Swear.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,</p>
<p>truepenny?</p>
<p>Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--</p>
<p>Consent to swear.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Propose the oath, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Never to speak of this that you have seen,</p>
<p>Swear by my sword.</p>



Ghost
<p>Beneath  Swear.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.</p>
<p>Come hither, gentlemen,</p>
<p>And lay your hands again upon my sword:</p>
<p>Never to speak of this that you have heard,</p>
<p>Swear by my sword.</p>



Ghost
<p>Beneath  Swear.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?</p>
<p>A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.</p>



HORATIO
<p>O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!</p>



HAMLET
<p>And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.</p>
<p>There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,</p>
<p>Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;</p>
<p>Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,</p>
<p>How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,</p>
<p>As I perchance hereafter shall think meet</p>
<p>To put an antic disposition on,</p>
<p>That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,</p>
<p>With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,</p>
<p>Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,</p>
<p>As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'</p>
<p>Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'</p>
<p>Or such ambiguous giving out, to note</p>
<p>That you know aught of me: this not to do,</p>
<p>So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.</p>



Ghost
<p>Beneath  Swear.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!</p>

<p>So, gentlemen,</p>
<p>With all my love I do commend me to you:</p>
<p>And what so poor a man as Hamlet is</p>
<p>May do, to express his love and friending to you,</p>
<p>God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;</p>
<p>And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.</p>
<p>The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,</p>
<p>That ever I was born to set it right!</p>
<p>Nay, come, let's go together.</p>





<h2>ACT II</h2>

<h3>SCENE I.  A room in POLONIUS' house.</h3>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.</p>



REYNALDO
<p>I will, my lord.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,</p>
<p>Before you visit him, to make inquire</p>
<p>Of his behavior.</p>



REYNALDO
<p>My lord, I did intend it.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,</p>
<p>Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;</p>
<p>And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,</p>
<p>What company, at what expense; and finding</p>
<p>By this encompassment and drift of question</p>
<p>That they do know my son, come you more nearer</p>
<p>Than your particular demands will touch it:</p>
<p>Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;</p>
<p>As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,</p>
<p>And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?</p>



REYNALDO
<p>Ay, very well, my lord.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:</p>
<p>But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;</p>
<p>Addicted so and so:' and there put on him</p>
<p>What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank</p>
<p>As may dishonour him; take heed of that;</p>
<p>But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips</p>
<p>As are companions noted and most known</p>
<p>To youth and liberty.</p>



REYNALDO
<p>As gaming, my lord.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,</p>
<p>Drabbing: you may go so far.</p>



REYNALDO
<p>My lord, that would dishonour him.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge</p>
<p>You must not put another scandal on him,</p>
<p>That he is open to incontinency;</p>
<p>That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly</p>
<p>That they may seem the taints of liberty,</p>
<p>The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,</p>
<p>A savageness in unreclaimed blood,</p>
<p>Of general assault.</p>



REYNALDO
<p>But, my good lord,--</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Wherefore should you do this?</p>



REYNALDO
<p>Ay, my lord,</p>
<p>I would know that.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Marry, sir, here's my drift;</p>
<p>And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:</p>
<p>You laying these slight sullies on my son,</p>
<p>As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,</p>
<p>Your party in converse, him you would sound,</p>
<p>Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</p>
<p>The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured</p>
<p>He closes with you in this consequence;</p>
<p>'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'</p>
<p>According to the phrase or the addition</p>
<p>Of man and country.</p>



REYNALDO
<p>Very good, my lord.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I</p>
<p>about to say? By the mass, I was about to say</p>
<p>something: where did I leave?</p>



REYNALDO
<p>At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'</p>
<p>and 'gentleman.'</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;</p>
<p>He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;</p>
<p>I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,</p>
<p>Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,</p>
<p>There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;</p>
<p>There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,</p>
<p>'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'</p>
<p>Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.</p>
<p>See you now;</p>
<p>Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:</p>
<p>And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</p>
<p>With windlasses and with assays of bias,</p>
<p>By indirections find directions out:</p>
<p>So by my former lecture and advice,</p>
<p>Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</p>



REYNALDO
<p>My lord, I have.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>God be wi' you; fare you well.</p>



REYNALDO
<p>Good my lord!</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Observe his inclination in yourself.</p>



REYNALDO
<p>I shall, my lord.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>And let him ply his music.</p>



REYNALDO
<p>Well, my lord.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Farewell!</p>


<p>How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>With what, i' the name of God?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,</p>
<p>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;</p>
<p>No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,</p>
<p>Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;</p>
<p>Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;</p>
<p>And with a look so piteous in purport</p>
<p>As if he had been loosed out of hell</p>
<p>To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Mad for thy love?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>My lord, I do not know;</p>
<p>But truly, I do fear it.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>What said he?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>He took me by the wrist and held me hard;</p>
<p>Then goes he to the length of all his arm;</p>
<p>And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,</p>
<p>He falls to such perusal of my face</p>
<p>As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;</p>
<p>At last, a little shaking of mine arm</p>
<p>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</p>
<p>He raised a sigh so piteous and profound</p>
<p>As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</p>
<p>And end his being: that done, he lets me go:</p>
<p>And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,</p>
<p>He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;</p>
<p>For out o' doors he went without their helps,</p>
<p>And, to the last, bended their light on me.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.</p>
<p>This is the very ecstasy of love,</p>
<p>Whose violent property fordoes itself</p>
<p>And leads the will to desperate undertakings</p>
<p>As oft as any passion under heaven</p>
<p>That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.</p>
<p>What, have you given him any hard words of late?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>No, my good lord, but, as you did command,</p>
<p>I did repel his fetters and denied</p>
<p>His access to me.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>That hath made him mad.</p>
<p>I am sorry that with better heed and judgment</p>
<p>I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,</p>
<p>And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!</p>
<p>By heaven, it is as proper to our age</p>
<p>To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions</p>
<p>As it is common for the younger sort</p>
<p>To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:</p>
<p>This must be known; which, being kept close, might</p>
<p>move</p>
<p>More grief to hide than hate to utter love.</p>





<h3>SCENE II.  A room in the castle.</h3>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!</p>
<p>Moreover that we much did long to see you,</p>
<p>The need we have to use you did provoke</p>
<p>Our hasty sending. Something have you heard</p>
<p>Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,</p>
<p>Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man</p>
<p>Resembles that it was. What it should be,</p>
<p>More than his father's death, that thus hath put him</p>
<p>So much from the understanding of himself,</p>
<p>I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,</p>
<p>That, being of so young days brought up with him,</p>
<p>And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,</p>
<p>That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court</p>
<p>Some little time: so by your companies</p>
<p>To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,</p>
<p>So much as from occasion you may glean,</p>
<p>Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,</p>
<p>That, open'd, lies within our remedy.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;</p>
<p>And sure I am two men there are not living</p>
<p>To whom he more adheres. If it will please you</p>
<p>To show us so much gentry and good will</p>
<p>As to expend your time with us awhile,</p>
<p>For the supply and profit of our hope,</p>
<p>Your visitation shall receive such thanks</p>
<p>As fits a king's remembrance.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Both your majesties</p>
<p>Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,</p>
<p>Put your dread pleasures more into command</p>
<p>Than to entreaty.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>But we both obey,</p>
<p>And here give up ourselves, in the full bent</p>
<p>To lay our service freely at your feet,</p>
<p>To be commanded.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:</p>
<p>And I beseech you instantly to visit</p>
<p>My too much changed son. Go, some of you,</p>
<p>And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>Heavens make our presence and our practises</p>
<p>Pleasant and helpful to him!</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Ay, amen!</p>






LORD POLONIUS
<p>The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,</p>
<p>Are joyfully return'd.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Thou still hast been the father of good news.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,</p>
<p>I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,</p>
<p>Both to my God and to my gracious king:</p>
<p>And I do think, or else this brain of mine</p>
<p>Hunts not the trail of policy so sure</p>
<p>As it hath used to do, that I have found</p>
<p>The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Give first admittance to the ambassadors;</p>
<p>My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.</p>

<p>He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found</p>
<p>The head and source of all your son's distemper.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>I doubt it is no other but the main;</p>
<p>His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Well, we shall sift him.</p>

<p>Welcome, my good friends!</p>
<p>Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?</p>



VOLTIMAND
<p>Most fair return of greetings and desires.</p>
<p>Upon our first, he sent out to suppress</p>
<p>His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd</p>
<p>To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;</p>
<p>But, better look'd into, he truly found</p>
<p>It was against your highness: whereat grieved,</p>
<p>That so his sickness, age and impotence</p>
<p>Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests</p>
<p>On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;</p>
<p>Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine</p>
<p>Makes vow before his uncle never more</p>
<p>To give the assay of arms against your majesty.</p>
<p>Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,</p>
<p>Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,</p>
<p>And his commission to employ those soldiers,</p>
<p>So levied as before, against the Polack:</p>
<p>With an entreaty, herein further shown,</p>

<p>That it might please you to give quiet pass</p>
<p>Through your dominions for this enterprise,</p>
<p>On such regards of safety and allowance</p>
<p>As therein are set down.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>It likes us well;</p>
<p>And at our more consider'd time well read,</p>
<p>Answer, and think upon this business.</p>
<p>Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:</p>
<p>Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:</p>
<p>Most welcome home!</p>





LORD POLONIUS
<p>This business is well ended.</p>
<p>My liege, and madam, to expostulate</p>
<p>What majesty should be, what duty is,</p>
<p>Why day is day, night night, and time is time,</p>
<p>Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.</p>
<p>Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,</p>
<p>And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,</p>
<p>I will be brief: your noble son is mad:</p>
<p>Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,</p>
<p>What is't but to be nothing else but mad?</p>
<p>But let that go.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>More matter, with less art.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Madam, I swear I use no art at all.</p>
<p>That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;</p>
<p>And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;</p>
<p>But farewell it, for I will use no art.</p>
<p>Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains</p>
<p>That we find out the cause of this effect,</p>
<p>Or rather say, the cause of this defect,</p>
<p>For this effect defective comes by cause:</p>
<p>Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.</p>
<p>I have a daughter--have while she is mine--</p>
<p>Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,</p>
<p>Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.</p>

<p>'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most</p>
<p>beautified Ophelia,'--</p>
<p>That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is</p>
<p>a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:</p>

<p>'In her excellent white bosom, these, &amp;c.'</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Came this from Hamlet to her?</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.</p>

<p>'Doubt thou the stars are fire;</p>
<p>Doubt that the sun doth move;</p>
<p>Doubt truth to be a liar;</p>
<p>But never doubt I love.</p>
<p>'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;</p>
<p>I have not art to reckon my groans: but that</p>
<p>I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.</p>
<p>'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst</p>
<p>this machine is to him, HAMLET.'</p>
<p>This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,</p>
<p>And more above, hath his solicitings,</p>
<p>As they fell out by time, by means and place,</p>
<p>All given to mine ear.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>But how hath she</p>
<p>Received his love?</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>What do you think of me?</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>As of a man faithful and honourable.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>I would fain prove so. But what might you think,</p>
<p>When I had seen this hot love on the wing--</p>
<p>As I perceived it, I must tell you that,</p>
<p>Before my daughter told me--what might you,</p>
<p>Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,</p>
<p>If I had play'd the desk or table-book,</p>
<p>Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,</p>
<p>Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;</p>
<p>What might you think? No, I went round to work,</p>
<p>And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:</p>
<p>'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;</p>
<p>This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,</p>
<p>That she should lock herself from his resort,</p>
<p>Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.</p>
<p>Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;</p>
<p>And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--</p>
<p>Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,</p>
<p>Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,</p>
<p>Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,</p>
<p>Into the madness wherein now he raves,</p>
<p>And all we mourn for.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Do you think 'tis this?</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>It may be, very likely.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--</p>
<p>That I have positively said 'Tis so,'</p>
<p>When it proved otherwise?</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Not that I know.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Pointing to his head and shoulder</p>
<p>Take this from this, if this be otherwise:</p>
<p>If circumstances lead me, I will find</p>
<p>Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed</p>
<p>Within the centre.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>How may we try it further?</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>You know, sometimes he walks four hours together</p>
<p>Here in the lobby.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>So he does indeed.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:</p>
<p>Be you and I behind an arras then;</p>
<p>Mark the encounter: if he love her not</p>
<p>And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,</p>
<p>Let me be no assistant for a state,</p>
<p>But keep a farm and carters.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>We will try it.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Away, I do beseech you, both away:</p>
<p>I'll board him presently.</p>


<p>O, give me leave:</p>
<p>How does my good Lord Hamlet?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Well, God-a-mercy.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Do you know me, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Not I, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Then I would you were so honest a man.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Honest, my lord!</p>



HAMLET
<p>Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be</p>
<p>one man picked out of ten thousand.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>That's very true, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a</p>
<p>god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>I have, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a</p>
<p>blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.</p>
<p>Friend, look to 't.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Aside  How say you by that? Still harping on my</p>
<p>daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I</p>
<p>was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and</p>
<p>truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for</p>
<p>love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.</p>
<p>What do you read, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Words, words, words.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>What is the matter, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Between who?</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here</p>
<p>that old men have grey beards, that their faces are</p>
<p>wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and</p>
<p>plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of</p>
<p>wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,</p>
<p>though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet</p>
<p>I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for</p>
<p>yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab</p>
<p>you could go backward.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Aside  Though this be madness, yet there is method</p>
<p>in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Into my grave.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Indeed, that is out o' the air.</p>

<p>How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness</p>
<p>that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity</p>
<p>could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will</p>
<p>leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of</p>
<p>meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable</p>
<p>lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.</p>



HAMLET
<p>You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will</p>
<p>more willingly part withal: except my life, except</p>
<p>my life, except my life.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Fare you well, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>These tedious old fools!</p>





LORD POLONIUS
<p>You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>To POLONIUS  God save you, sir!</p>





GUILDENSTERN
<p>My honoured lord!</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>My most dear lord!</p>



HAMLET
<p>My excellent good friends! How dost thou,</p>
<p>Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>As the indifferent children of the earth.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>Happy, in that we are not over-happy;</p>
<p>On fortune's cap we are not the very button.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Nor the soles of her shoe?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Neither, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of</p>
<p>her favours?</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>'Faith, her privates we.</p>



HAMLET
<p>In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she</p>
<p>is a strumpet. What's the news?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.</p>
<p>Let me question more in particular: what have you,</p>
<p>my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,</p>
<p>that she sends you to prison hither?</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>Prison, my lord!</p>



HAMLET
<p>Denmark's a prison.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Then is the world one.</p>



HAMLET
<p>A goodly one; in which there are many confines,</p>
<p>wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>We think not so, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing</p>
<p>either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me</p>
<p>it is a prison.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too</p>
<p>narrow for your mind.</p>



HAMLET
<p>O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count</p>
<p>myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I</p>
<p>have bad dreams.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very</p>
<p>substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.</p>



HAMLET
<p>A dream itself is but a shadow.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a</p>
<p>quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and</p>
<p>outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we</p>
<p>to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
GUILDENSTERN
<p>We'll wait upon you.</p>



HAMLET
<p>No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest</p>
<p>of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest</p>
<p>man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the</p>
<p>beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I</p>
<p>thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are</p>
<p>too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it</p>
<p>your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,</p>
<p>deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>What should we say, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent</p>
<p>for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks</p>
<p>which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:</p>
<p>I know the good king and queen have sent for you.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>To what end, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by</p>
<p>the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of</p>
<p>our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved</p>
<p>love, and by what more dear a better proposer could</p>
<p>charge you withal, be even and direct with me,</p>
<p>whether you were sent for, or no?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Aside to GUILDENSTERN  What say you?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Aside  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you</p>
<p>love me, hold not off.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>My lord, we were sent for.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation</p>
<p>prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king</p>
<p>and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but</p>
<p>wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all</p>
<p>custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily</p>
<p>with my disposition that this goodly frame, the</p>
<p>earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most</p>
<p>excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave</p>
<p>o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted</p>
<p>with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to</p>
<p>me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.</p>
<p>What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!</p>
<p>how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how</p>
<p>express and admirable! in action how like an angel!</p>
<p>in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the</p>
<p>world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,</p>
<p>what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not</p>
<p>me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling</p>
<p>you seem to say so.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what</p>
<p>lenten entertainment the players shall receive from</p>
<p>you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they</p>
<p>coming, to offer you service.</p>



HAMLET
<p>He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty</p>
<p>shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight</p>
<p>shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not</p>
<p>sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part</p>
<p>in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose</p>
<p>lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall</p>
<p>say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt</p>
<p>for't. What players are they?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Even those you were wont to take delight in, the</p>
<p>tragedians of the city.</p>



HAMLET
<p>How chances it they travel? their residence, both</p>
<p>in reputation and profit, was better both ways.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>I think their inhibition comes by the means of the</p>
<p>late innovation.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was</p>
<p>in the city? are they so followed?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>No, indeed, are they not.</p>



HAMLET
<p>How comes it? do they grow rusty?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but</p>
<p>there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,</p>
<p>that cry out on the top of question, and are most</p>
<p>tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the</p>
<p>fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they</p>
<p>call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of</p>
<p>goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.</p>



HAMLET
<p>What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are</p>
<p>they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no</p>
<p>longer than they can sing? will they not say</p>
<p>afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common</p>
<p>players--as it is most like, if their means are no</p>
<p>better--their writers do them wrong, to make them</p>
<p>exclaim against their own succession?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and</p>
<p>the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to</p>
<p>controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid</p>
<p>for argument, unless the poet and the player went to</p>
<p>cuffs in the question.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Is't possible?</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>O, there has been much throwing about of brains.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Do the boys carry it away?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.</p>



HAMLET
<p>It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of</p>
<p>Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while</p>
<p>my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an</p>
<p>hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.</p>
<p>'Sblood, there is something in this more than</p>
<p>natural, if philosophy could find it out.</p>





GUILDENSTERN
<p>There are the players.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,</p>
<p>come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion</p>
<p>and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,</p>
<p>lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,</p>
<p>must show fairly outward, should more appear like</p>
<p>entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my</p>
<p>uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>In what, my dear lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is</p>
<p>southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.</p>





LORD POLONIUS
<p>Well be with you, gentlemen!</p>



HAMLET
<p>Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a</p>
<p>hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet</p>
<p>out of his swaddling-clouts.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Happily he's the second time come to them; for they</p>
<p>say an old man is twice a child.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;</p>
<p>mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;</p>
<p>'twas so indeed.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>My lord, I have news to tell you.</p>



HAMLET
<p>My lord, I have news to tell you.</p>
<p>When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>The actors are come hither, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Buz, buz!</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Upon mine honour,--</p>



HAMLET
<p>Then came each actor on his ass,--</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,</p>
<p>comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,</p>
<p>historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-</p>
<p>comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or</p>
<p>poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor</p>
<p>Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the</p>
<p>liberty, these are the only men.</p>



HAMLET
<p>O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>What a treasure had he, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Why,</p>
<p>'One fair daughter and no more,</p>
<p>The which he loved passing well.'</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Aside  Still on my daughter.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter</p>
<p>that I love passing well.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Nay, that follows not.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>What follows, then, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Why,</p>
<p>'As by lot, God wot,'</p>
<p>and then, you know,</p>
<p>'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--</p>
<p>the first row of the pious chanson will show you</p>
<p>more; for look, where my abridgement comes.</p>

<p>You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad</p>
<p>to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old</p>
<p>friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:</p>
<p>comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young</p>
<p>lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is</p>
<p>nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the</p>
<p>altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like</p>
<p>apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the</p>
<p>ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en</p>
<p>to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:</p>
<p>we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste</p>
<p>of your quality; come, a passionate speech.</p>



First Player
<p>What speech, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was</p>
<p>never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the</p>
<p>play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas</p>
<p>caviare to the general: but it was--as I received</p>
<p>it, and others, whose judgments in such matters</p>
<p>cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well</p>
<p>digested in the scenes, set down with as much</p>
<p>modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there</p>
<p>were no sallets in the lines to make the matter</p>
<p>savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might</p>
<p>indict the author of affectation; but called it an</p>
<p>honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very</p>
<p>much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I</p>
<p>chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and</p>
<p>thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of</p>
<p>Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin</p>
<p>at this line: let me see, let me see--</p>
<p>'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--</p>
<p>it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--</p>
<p>'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,</p>
<p>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</p>
<p>When he lay couched in the ominous horse,</p>
<p>Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd</p>
<p>With heraldry more dismal; head to foot</p>
<p>Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd</p>
<p>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,</p>
<p>Baked and impasted with the parching streets,</p>
<p>That lend a tyrannous and damned light</p>
<p>To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,</p>
<p>And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,</p>
<p>With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</p>
<p>Old grandsire Priam seeks.'</p>
<p>So, proceed you.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and</p>
<p>good discretion.</p>



First Player
<p>'Anon he finds him</p>
<p>Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,</p>
<p>Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,</p>
<p>Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,</p>
<p>Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;</p>
<p>But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword</p>
<p>The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,</p>
<p>Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</p>
<p>Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</p>
<p>Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,</p>
<p>Which was declining on the milky head</p>
<p>Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:</p>
<p>So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,</p>
<p>And like a neutral to his will and matter,</p>
<p>Did nothing.</p>
<p>But, as we often see, against some storm,</p>
<p>A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,</p>
<p>The bold winds speechless and the orb below</p>
<p>As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder</p>
<p>Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,</p>
<p>Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;</p>
<p>And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall</p>
<p>On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne</p>
<p>With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword</p>
<p>Now falls on Priam.</p>
<p>Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,</p>
<p>In general synod 'take away her power;</p>
<p>Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,</p>
<p>And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,</p>
<p>As low as to the fiends!'</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>This is too long.</p>



HAMLET
<p>It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,</p>
<p>say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he</p>
<p>sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.</p>



First Player
<p>'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'</p>



HAMLET
<p>'The mobled queen?'</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.</p>



First Player
<p>'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames</p>
<p>With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head</p>
<p>Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,</p>
<p>About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,</p>
<p>A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;</p>
<p>Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,</p>
<p>'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have</p>
<p>pronounced:</p>
<p>But if the gods themselves did see her then</p>
<p>When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport</p>
<p>In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,</p>
<p>The instant burst of clamour that she made,</p>
<p>Unless things mortal move them not at all,</p>
<p>Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,</p>
<p>And passion in the gods.'</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has</p>
<p>tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.</p>



HAMLET
<p>'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.</p>
<p>Good my lord, will you see the players well</p>
<p>bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for</p>
<p>they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the</p>
<p>time: after your death you were better have a bad</p>
<p>epitaph than their ill report while you live.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>My lord, I will use them according to their desert.</p>



HAMLET
<p>God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man</p>
<p>after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?</p>
<p>Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less</p>
<p>they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.</p>
<p>Take them in.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Come, sirs.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.</p>

<p>Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the</p>
<p>Murder of Gonzago?</p>



First Player
<p>Ay, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,</p>
<p>study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which</p>
<p>I would set down and insert in't, could you not?</p>



First Player
<p>Ay, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him</p>
<p>not.</p>

<p>My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are</p>
<p>welcome to Elsinore.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Good my lord!</p>



HAMLET
<p>Ay, so, God be wi' ye;</p>

<p>Now I am alone.</p>
<p>O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!</p>
<p>Is it not monstrous that this player here,</p>
<p>But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,</p>
<p>Could force his soul so to his own conceit</p>
<p>That from her working all his visage wann'd,</p>
<p>Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,</p>
<p>A broken voice, and his whole function suiting</p>
<p>With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!</p>
<p>For Hecuba!</p>
<p>What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,</p>
<p>That he should weep for her? What would he do,</p>
<p>Had he the motive and the cue for passion</p>
<p>That I have? He would drown the stage with tears</p>
<p>And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,</p>
<p>Make mad the guilty and appal the free,</p>
<p>Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed</p>
<p>The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,</p>
<p>A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,</p>
<p>Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,</p>
<p>And can say nothing; no, not for a king,</p>
<p>Upon whose property and most dear life</p>
<p>A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?</p>
<p>Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?</p>
<p>Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?</p>
<p>Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,</p>
<p>As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be</p>
<p>But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall</p>
<p>To make oppression bitter, or ere this</p>
<p>I should have fatted all the region kites</p>
<p>With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!</p>
<p>Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!</p>
<p>O, vengeance!</p>
<p>Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,</p>
<p>That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,</p>
<p>Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,</p>
<p>Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,</p>
<p>And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,</p>
<p>A scullion!</p>
<p>Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard</p>
<p>That guilty creatures sitting at a play</p>
<p>Have by the very cunning of the scene</p>
<p>Been struck so to the soul that presently</p>
<p>They have proclaim'd their malefactions;</p>
<p>For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak</p>
<p>With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players</p>
<p>Play something like the murder of my father</p>
<p>Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;</p>
<p>I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,</p>
<p>I know my course. The spirit that I have seen</p>
<p>May be the devil: and the devil hath power</p>
<p>To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps</p>
<p>Out of my weakness and my melancholy,</p>
<p>As he is very potent with such spirits,</p>
<p>Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds</p>
<p>More relative than this: the play 's the thing</p>
<p>Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.</p>





<h2>ACT III</h2>

<h3>SCENE I.  A room in the castle.</h3>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>And can you, by no drift of circumstance,</p>
<p>Get from him why he puts on this confusion,</p>
<p>Grating so harshly all his days of quiet</p>
<p>With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>He does confess he feels himself distracted;</p>
<p>But from what cause he will by no means speak.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,</p>
<p>But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,</p>
<p>When we would bring him on to some confession</p>
<p>Of his true state.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Did he receive you well?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Most like a gentleman.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>But with much forcing of his disposition.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Niggard of question; but, of our demands,</p>
<p>Most free in his reply.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Did you assay him?</p>
<p>To any pastime?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Madam, it so fell out, that certain players</p>
<p>We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;</p>
<p>And there did seem in him a kind of joy</p>
<p>To hear of it: they are about the court,</p>
<p>And, as I think, they have already order</p>
<p>This night to play before him.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>'Tis most true:</p>
<p>And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties</p>
<p>To hear and see the matter.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>With all my heart; and it doth much content me</p>
<p>To hear him so inclined.</p>
<p>Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,</p>
<p>And drive his purpose on to these delights.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>We shall, my lord.</p>





KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;</p>
<p>For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,</p>
<p>That he, as 'twere by accident, may here</p>
<p>Affront Ophelia:</p>
<p>Her father and myself, lawful espials,</p>
<p>Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,</p>
<p>We may of their encounter frankly judge,</p>
<p>And gather by him, as he is behaved,</p>
<p>If 't be the affliction of his love or no</p>
<p>That thus he suffers for.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>I shall obey you.</p>
<p>And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish</p>
<p>That your good beauties be the happy cause</p>
<p>Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues</p>
<p>Will bring him to his wonted way again,</p>
<p>To both your honours.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Madam, I wish it may.</p>





LORD POLONIUS
<p>Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,</p>
<p>We will bestow ourselves.</p>

<p>Read on this book;</p>
<p>That show of such an exercise may colour</p>
<p>Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--</p>
<p>'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage</p>
<p>And pious action we do sugar o'er</p>
<p>The devil himself.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Aside          O, 'tis too true!</p>
<p>How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!</p>
<p>The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,</p>
<p>Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it</p>
<p>Than is my deed to my most painted word:</p>
<p>O heavy burthen!</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.</p>






HAMLET
<p>To be, or not to be: that is the question:</p>
<p>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</p>
<p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</p>
<p>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</p>
<p>And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;</p>
<p>No more; and by a sleep to say we end</p>
<p>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks</p>
<p>That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation</p>
<p>Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;</p>
<p>To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;</p>
<p>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come</p>
<p>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</p>
<p>Must give us pause: there's the respect</p>
<p>That makes calamity of so long life;</p>
<p>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</p>
<p>The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,</p>
<p>The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,</p>
<p>The insolence of office and the spurns</p>
<p>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,</p>
<p>When he himself might his quietus make</p>
<p>With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,</p>
<p>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</p>
<p>But that the dread of something after death,</p>
<p>The undiscover'd country from whose bourn</p>
<p>No traveller returns, puzzles the will</p>
<p>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</p>
<p>Than fly to others that we know not of?</p>
<p>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;</p>
<p>And thus the native hue of resolution</p>
<p>Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,</p>
<p>And enterprises of great pith and moment</p>
<p>With this regard their currents turn awry,</p>
<p>And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!</p>
<p>The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons</p>
<p>Be all my sins remember'd.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Good my lord,</p>
<p>How does your honour for this many a day?</p>



HAMLET
<p>I humbly thank you; well, well, well.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>My lord, I have remembrances of yours,</p>
<p>That I have longed long to re-deliver;</p>
<p>I pray you, now receive them.</p>



HAMLET
<p>No, not I;</p>
<p>I never gave you aught.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;</p>
<p>And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed</p>
<p>As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,</p>
<p>Take these again; for to the noble mind</p>
<p>Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.</p>
<p>There, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Ha, ha! are you honest?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>My lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Are you fair?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>What means your lordship?</p>



HAMLET
<p>That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should</p>
<p>admit no discourse to your beauty.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than</p>
<p>with honesty?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner</p>
<p>transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the</p>
<p>force of honesty can translate beauty into his</p>
<p>likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the</p>
<p>time gives it proof. I did love you once.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.</p>



HAMLET
<p>You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot</p>
<p>so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of</p>
<p>it: I loved you not.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>I was the more deceived.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a</p>
<p>breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;</p>
<p>but yet I could accuse me of such things that it</p>
<p>were better my mother had not borne me: I am very</p>
<p>proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at</p>
<p>my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,</p>
<p>imagination to give them shape, or time to act them</p>
<p>in. What should such fellows as I do crawling</p>
<p>between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,</p>
<p>all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.</p>
<p>Where's your father?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>At home, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the</p>
<p>fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>O, help him, you sweet heavens!</p>



HAMLET
<p>If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for</p>
<p>thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as</p>
<p>snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a</p>
<p>nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs</p>
<p>marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough</p>
<p>what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,</p>
<p>and quickly too. Farewell.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>O heavenly powers, restore him!</p>



HAMLET
<p>I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God</p>
<p>has given you one face, and you make yourselves</p>
<p>another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and</p>
<p>nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness</p>
<p>your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath</p>
<p>made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:</p>
<p>those that are married already, all but one, shall</p>
<p>live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a</p>
<p>nunnery, go.</p>





OPHELIA
<p>O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!</p>
<p>The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;</p>
<p>The expectancy and rose of the fair state,</p>
<p>The glass of fashion and the mould of form,</p>
<p>The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!</p>
<p>And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,</p>
<p>That suck'd the honey of his music vows,</p>
<p>Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,</p>
<p>Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;</p>
<p>That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth</p>
<p>Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,</p>
<p>To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!</p>





KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Love! his affections do not that way tend;</p>
<p>Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,</p>
<p>Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,</p>
<p>O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;</p>
<p>And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose</p>
<p>Will be some danger: which for to prevent,</p>
<p>I have in quick determination</p>
<p>Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,</p>
<p>For the demand of our neglected tribute</p>
<p>Haply the seas and countries different</p>
<p>With variable objects shall expel</p>
<p>This something-settled matter in his heart,</p>
<p>Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus</p>
<p>From fashion of himself. What think you on't?</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>It shall do well: but yet do I believe</p>
<p>The origin and commencement of his grief</p>
<p>Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!</p>
<p>You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;</p>
<p>We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;</p>
<p>But, if you hold it fit, after the play</p>
<p>Let his queen mother all alone entreat him</p>
<p>To show his grief: let her be round with him;</p>
<p>And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear</p>
<p>Of all their conference. If she find him not,</p>
<p>To England send him, or confine him where</p>
<p>Your wisdom best shall think.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>It shall be so:</p>
<p>Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.</p>





<h3>SCENE II.  A hall in the castle.</h3>



HAMLET
<p>Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to</p>
<p>you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,</p>
<p>as many of your players do, I had as lief the</p>
<p>town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air</p>
<p>too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;</p>
<p>for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,</p>
<p>the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget</p>
<p>a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it</p>
<p>offends me to the soul to hear a robustious</p>
<p>periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to</p>
<p>very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who</p>
<p>for the most part are capable of nothing but</p>
<p>inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such</p>
<p>a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it</p>
<p>out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.</p>



First Player
<p>I warrant your honour.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion</p>
<p>be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the</p>
<p>word to the action; with this special o'erstep not</p>
<p>the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is</p>
<p>from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the</p>
<p>first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the</p>
<p>mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,</p>
<p>scorn her own image, and the very age and body of</p>
<p>the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,</p>
<p>or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful</p>
<p>laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the</p>
<p>censure of the which one must in your allowance</p>
<p>o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be</p>
<p>players that I have seen play, and heard others</p>
<p>praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,</p>
<p>that, neither having the accent of Christians nor</p>
<p>the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so</p>
<p>strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of</p>
<p>nature's journeymen had made men and not made them</p>
<p>well, they imitated humanity so abominably.</p>



First Player
<p>I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,</p>
<p>sir.</p>



HAMLET
<p>O, reform it altogether. And let those that play</p>
<p>your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;</p>
<p>for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to</p>
<p>set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh</p>
<p>too; though, in the mean time, some necessary</p>
<p>question of the play be then to be considered:</p>
<p>that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition</p>
<p>in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.</p>


<p>How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>And the queen too, and that presently.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Bid the players make haste.</p>

<p>Will you two help to hasten them?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
GUILDENSTERN
<p>We will, my lord.</p>





HAMLET
<p>What ho! Horatio!</p>





HORATIO
<p>Here, sweet lord, at your service.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man</p>
<p>As e'er my conversation coped withal.</p>



HORATIO
<p>O, my dear lord,--</p>



HAMLET
<p>Nay, do not think I flatter;</p>
<p>For what advancement may I hope from thee</p>
<p>That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,</p>
<p>To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?</p>
<p>No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,</p>
<p>And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee</p>
<p>Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?</p>
<p>Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice</p>
<p>And could of men distinguish, her election</p>
<p>Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been</p>
<p>As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,</p>
<p>A man that fortune's buffets and rewards</p>
<p>Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those</p>
<p>Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,</p>
<p>That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger</p>
<p>To sound what stop she please. Give me that man</p>
<p>That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him</p>
<p>In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,</p>
<p>As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--</p>
<p>There is a play to-night before the king;</p>
<p>One scene of it comes near the circumstance</p>
<p>Which I have told thee of my father's death:</p>
<p>I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,</p>
<p>Even with the very comment of thy soul</p>
<p>Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt</p>
<p>Do not itself unkennel in one speech,</p>
<p>It is a damned ghost that we have seen,</p>
<p>And my imaginations are as foul</p>
<p>As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;</p>
<p>For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,</p>
<p>And after we will both our judgments join</p>
<p>In censure of his seeming.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Well, my lord:</p>
<p>If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,</p>
<p>And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.</p>



HAMLET
<p>They are coming to the play; I must be idle:</p>
<p>Get you a place.</p>





KING CLAUDIUS
<p>How fares our cousin Hamlet?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat</p>
<p>the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words</p>
<p>are not mine.</p>



HAMLET
<p>No, nor mine now.</p>

<p>My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.</p>



HAMLET
<p>What did you enact?</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the</p>
<p>Capitol; Brutus killed me.</p>



HAMLET
<p>It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf</p>
<p>there. Be the players ready?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.</p>



HAMLET
<p>No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>To KING CLAUDIUS  O, ho! do you mark that?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Lady, shall I lie in your lap?</p>





OPHELIA
<p>No, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I mean, my head upon your lap?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Ay, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Do you think I meant country matters?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>I think nothing, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>What is, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Nothing.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>You are merry, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Who, I?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Ay, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do</p>
<p>but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my</p>
<p>mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for</p>
<p>I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two</p>
<p>months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's</p>
<p>hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half</p>
<p>a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,</p>
<p>then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with</p>
<p>the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,</p>
<p>the hobby-horse is forgot.'</p>







OPHELIA
<p>What means this, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Belike this show imports the argument of the play.</p>





HAMLET
<p>We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot</p>
<p>keep counsel; they'll tell all.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Will he tell us what this show meant?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you</p>
<p>ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.</p>



Prologue
<p>For us, and for our tragedy,</p>
<p>Here stooping to your clemency,</p>
<p>We beg your hearing patiently.</p>





HAMLET
<p>Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>'Tis brief, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>As woman's love.</p>





Player King
<p>Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round</p>
<p>Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,</p>
<p>And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen</p>
<p>About the world have times twelve thirties been,</p>
<p>Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands</p>
<p>Unite commutual in most sacred bands.</p>



Player Queen
<p>So many journeys may the sun and moon</p>
<p>Make us again count o'er ere love be done!</p>
<p>But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,</p>
<p>So far from cheer and from your former state,</p>
<p>That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,</p>
<p>Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:</p>
<p>For women's fear and love holds quantity;</p>
<p>In neither aught, or in extremity.</p>
<p>Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;</p>
<p>And as my love is sized, my fear is so:</p>
<p>Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;</p>
<p>Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.</p>



Player King
<p>'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;</p>
<p>My operant powers their functions leave to do:</p>
<p>And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,</p>
<p>Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind</p>
<p>For husband shalt thou--</p>



Player Queen
<p>O, confound the rest!</p>
<p>Such love must needs be treason in my breast:</p>
<p>In second husband let me be accurst!</p>
<p>None wed the second but who kill'd the first.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Aside  Wormwood, wormwood.</p>



Player Queen
<p>The instances that second marriage move</p>
<p>Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:</p>
<p>A second time I kill my husband dead,</p>
<p>When second husband kisses me in bed.</p>



Player King
<p>I do believe you think what now you speak;</p>
<p>But what we do determine oft we break.</p>
<p>Purpose is but the slave to memory,</p>
<p>Of violent birth, but poor validity;</p>
<p>Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;</p>
<p>But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.</p>
<p>Most necessary 'tis that we forget</p>
<p>To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:</p>
<p>What to ourselves in passion we propose,</p>
<p>The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.</p>
<p>The violence of either grief or joy</p>
<p>Their own enactures with themselves destroy:</p>
<p>Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;</p>
<p>Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.</p>
<p>This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange</p>
<p>That even our loves should with our fortunes change;</p>
<p>For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,</p>
<p>Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.</p>
<p>The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;</p>
<p>The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.</p>
<p>And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;</p>
<p>For who not needs shall never lack a friend,</p>
<p>And who in want a hollow friend doth try,</p>
<p>Directly seasons him his enemy.</p>
<p>But, orderly to end where I begun,</p>
<p>Our wills and fates do so contrary run</p>
<p>That our devices still are overthrown;</p>
<p>Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:</p>
<p>So think thou wilt no second husband wed;</p>
<p>But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.</p>



Player Queen
<p>Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!</p>
<p>Sport and repose lock from me day and night!</p>
<p>To desperation turn my trust and hope!</p>
<p>An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!</p>
<p>Each opposite that blanks the face of joy</p>
<p>Meet what I would have well and it destroy!</p>
<p>Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,</p>
<p>If, once a widow, ever I be wife!</p>



HAMLET
<p>If she should break it now!</p>



Player King
<p>'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;</p>
<p>My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile</p>
<p>The tedious day with sleep.</p>





Player Queen
<p>Sleep rock thy brain,</p>
<p>And never come mischance between us twain!</p>





HAMLET
<p>Madam, how like you this play?</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>The lady protests too much, methinks.</p>



HAMLET
<p>O, but she'll keep her word.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?</p>



HAMLET
<p>No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence</p>
<p>i' the world.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>What do you call the play?</p>



HAMLET
<p>The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play</p>
<p>is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is</p>
<p>the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see</p>
<p>anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'</p>
<p>that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it</p>
<p>touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our</p>
<p>withers are unwrung.</p>

<p>This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>You are as good as a chorus, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I could interpret between you and your love, if I</p>
<p>could see the puppets dallying.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>You are keen, my lord, you are keen.</p>



HAMLET
<p>It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Still better, and worse.</p>



HAMLET
<p>So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;</p>
<p>pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:</p>
<p>'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'</p>



LUCIANUS
<p>Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;</p>
<p>Confederate season, else no creature seeing;</p>
<p>Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,</p>
<p>With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,</p>
<p>Thy natural magic and dire property,</p>
<p>On wholesome life usurp immediately.</p>





HAMLET
<p>He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His</p>
<p>name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in</p>
<p>choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer</p>
<p>gets the love of Gonzago's wife.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>The king rises.</p>



HAMLET
<p>What, frighted with false fire!</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>How fares my lord?</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Give o'er the play.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Give me some light: away!</p>



All
<p>Lights, lights, lights!</p>





HAMLET
<p>Why, let the stricken deer go weep,</p>
<p>The hart ungalled play;</p>
<p>For some must watch, while some must sleep:</p>
<p>So runs the world away.</p>
<p>Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if</p>
<p>the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two</p>
<p>Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a</p>
<p>fellowship in a cry of players, sir?</p>



HORATIO
<p>Half a share.</p>



HAMLET
<p>A whole one, I.</p>
<p>For thou dost know, O Damon dear,</p>
<p>This realm dismantled was</p>
<p>Of Jove himself; and now reigns here</p>
<p>A very, very--pajock.</p>



HORATIO
<p>You might have rhymed.</p>



HAMLET
<p>O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a</p>
<p>thousand pound. Didst perceive?</p>



HORATIO
<p>Very well, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Upon the talk of the poisoning?</p>



HORATIO
<p>I did very well note him.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!</p>
<p>For if the king like not the comedy,</p>
<p>Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.</p>
<p>Come, some music!</p>





GUILDENSTERN
<p>Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Sir, a whole history.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>The king, sir,--</p>



HAMLET
<p>Ay, sir, what of him?</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.</p>



HAMLET
<p>With drink, sir?</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>No, my lord, rather with choler.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Your wisdom should show itself more richer to</p>
<p>signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him</p>
<p>to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far</p>
<p>more choler.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and</p>
<p>start not so wildly from my affair.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I am tame, sir: pronounce.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of</p>
<p>spirit, hath sent me to you.</p>



HAMLET
<p>You are welcome.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right</p>
<p>breed. If it shall please you to make me a</p>
<p>wholesome answer, I will do your mother's</p>
<p>commandment: if not, your pardon and my return</p>
<p>shall be the end of my business.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Sir, I cannot.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>What, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,</p>
<p>sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;</p>
<p>or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no</p>
<p>more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her</p>
<p>into amazement and admiration.</p>



HAMLET
<p>O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But</p>
<p>is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's</p>
<p>admiration? Impart.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you</p>
<p>go to bed.</p>



HAMLET
<p>We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have</p>
<p>you any further trade with us?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>My lord, you once did love me.</p>



HAMLET
<p>So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you</p>
<p>do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if</p>
<p>you deny your griefs to your friend.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Sir, I lack advancement.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>How can that be, when you have the voice of the king</p>
<p>himself for your succession in Denmark?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb</p>
<p>is something musty.</p>

<p>O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with</p>
<p>you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,</p>
<p>as if you would drive me into a toil?</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too</p>
<p>unmannerly.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I do not well understand that. Will you play upon</p>
<p>this pipe?</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>My lord, I cannot.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I pray you.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>Believe me, I cannot.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I do beseech you.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>I know no touch of it, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with</p>
<p>your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your</p>
<p>mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.</p>
<p>Look you, these are the stops.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>But these cannot I command to any utterance of</p>
<p>harmony; I have not the skill.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of</p>
<p>me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know</p>
<p>my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my</p>
<p>mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to</p>
<p>the top of my compass: and there is much music,</p>
<p>excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot</p>
<p>you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am</p>
<p>easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what</p>
<p>instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you</p>
<p>cannot play upon me.</p>

<p>God bless you, sir!</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>My lord, the queen would speak with you, and</p>
<p>presently.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Methinks it is like a weasel.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>It is backed like a weasel.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Or like a whale?</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Very like a whale.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool</p>
<p>me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>I will say so.</p>



HAMLET
<p>By and by is easily said.</p>

<p>Leave me, friends.</p>

<p>Tis now the very witching time of night,</p>
<p>When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out</p>
<p>Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,</p>
<p>And do such bitter business as the day</p>
<p>Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.</p>
<p>O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever</p>
<p>The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:</p>
<p>Let me be cruel, not unnatural:</p>
<p>I will speak daggers to her, but use none;</p>
<p>My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;</p>
<p>How in my words soever she be shent,</p>
<p>To give them seals never, my soul, consent!</p>





<h3>SCENE III.  A room in the castle.</h3>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>I like him not, nor stands it safe with us</p>
<p>To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;</p>
<p>I your commission will forthwith dispatch,</p>
<p>And he to England shall along with you:</p>
<p>The terms of our estate may not endure</p>
<p>Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow</p>
<p>Out of his lunacies.</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>We will ourselves provide:</p>
<p>Most holy and religious fear it is</p>
<p>To keep those many many bodies safe</p>
<p>That live and feed upon your majesty.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>The single and peculiar life is bound,</p>
<p>With all the strength and armour of the mind,</p>
<p>To keep itself from noyance; but much more</p>
<p>That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest</p>
<p>The lives of many. The cease of majesty</p>
<p>Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw</p>
<p>What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,</p>
<p>Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,</p>
<p>To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things</p>
<p>Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,</p>
<p>Each small annexment, petty consequence,</p>
<p>Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone</p>
<p>Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;</p>
<p>For we will fetters put upon this fear,</p>
<p>Which now goes too free-footed.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
GUILDENSTERN
<p>We will haste us.</p>






LORD POLONIUS
<p>My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:</p>
<p>Behind the arras I'll convey myself,</p>
<p>To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:</p>
<p>And, as you said, and wisely was it said,</p>
<p>'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,</p>
<p>Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear</p>
<p>The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:</p>
<p>I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,</p>
<p>And tell you what I know.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Thanks, dear my lord.</p>

<p>O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;</p>
<p>It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,</p>
<p>A brother's murder. Pray can I not,</p>
<p>Though inclination be as sharp as will:</p>
<p>My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;</p>
<p>And, like a man to double business bound,</p>
<p>I stand in pause where I shall first begin,</p>
<p>And both neglect. What if this cursed hand</p>
<p>Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,</p>
<p>Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens</p>
<p>To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy</p>
<p>But to confront the visage of offence?</p>
<p>And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,</p>
<p>To be forestalled ere we come to fall,</p>
<p>Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;</p>
<p>My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer</p>
<p>Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?</p>
<p>That cannot be; since I am still possess'd</p>
<p>Of those effects for which I did the murder,</p>
<p>My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.</p>
<p>May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?</p>
<p>In the corrupted currents of this world</p>
<p>Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,</p>
<p>And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself</p>
<p>Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;</p>
<p>There is no shuffling, there the action lies</p>
<p>In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,</p>
<p>Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,</p>
<p>To give in evidence. What then? what rests?</p>
<p>Try what repentance can: what can it not?</p>
<p>Yet what can it when one can not repent?</p>
<p>O wretched state! O bosom black as death!</p>
<p>O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,</p>
<p>Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!</p>
<p>Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,</p>
<p>Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!</p>
<p>All may be well.</p>






HAMLET
<p>Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;</p>
<p>And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;</p>
<p>And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:</p>
<p>A villain kills my father; and for that,</p>
<p>I, his sole son, do this same villain send</p>
<p>To heaven.</p>
<p>O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.</p>
<p>He took my father grossly, full of bread;</p>
<p>With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;</p>
<p>And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?</p>
<p>But in our circumstance and course of thought,</p>
<p>'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,</p>
<p>To take him in the purging of his soul,</p>
<p>When he is fit and season'd for his passage?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:</p>
<p>When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,</p>
<p>Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;</p>
<p>At gaming, swearing, or about some act</p>
<p>That has no relish of salvation in't;</p>
<p>Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,</p>
<p>And that his soul may be as damn'd and black</p>
<p>As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:</p>
<p>This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.</p>





KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Rising  My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:</p>
<p>Words without thoughts never to heaven go.</p>





<h3>SCENE IV.  The Queen's closet.</h3>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:</p>
<p>Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,</p>
<p>And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between</p>
<p>Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.</p>
<p>Pray you, be round with him.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Within  Mother, mother, mother!</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>I'll warrant you,</p>
<p>Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.</p>






HAMLET
<p>Now, mother, what's the matter?</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Mother, you have my father much offended.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Why, how now, Hamlet!</p>



HAMLET
<p>What's the matter now?</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Have you forgot me?</p>



HAMLET
<p>No, by the rood, not so:</p>
<p>You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;</p>
<p>And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;</p>
<p>You go not till I set you up a glass</p>
<p>Where you may see the inmost part of you.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?</p>
<p>Help, help, ho!</p>



LORD POLONIUS
<p>Behind  What, ho! help, help, help!</p>



HAMLET
<p>Drawing  How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!</p>





LORD POLONIUS
<p>Behind  O, I am slain!</p>





QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>O me, what hast thou done?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Nay, I know not:</p>
<p>Is it the king?</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!</p>



HAMLET
<p>A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,</p>
<p>As kill a king, and marry with his brother.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>As kill a king!</p>



HAMLET
<p>Ay, lady, 'twas my word.</p>

<p>Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!</p>
<p>I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;</p>
<p>Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.</p>
<p>Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,</p>
<p>And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,</p>
<p>If it be made of penetrable stuff,</p>
<p>If damned custom have not brass'd it so</p>
<p>That it is proof and bulwark against sense.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue</p>
<p>In noise so rude against me?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Such an act</p>
<p>That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,</p>
<p>Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose</p>
<p>From the fair forehead of an innocent love</p>
<p>And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows</p>
<p>As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed</p>
<p>As from the body of contraction plucks</p>
<p>The very soul, and sweet religion makes</p>
<p>A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:</p>
<p>Yea, this solidity and compound mass,</p>
<p>With tristful visage, as against the doom,</p>
<p>Is thought-sick at the act.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Ay me, what act,</p>
<p>That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Look here, upon this picture, and on this,</p>
<p>The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.</p>
<p>See, what a grace was seated on this brow;</p>
<p>Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;</p>
<p>An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;</p>
<p>A station like the herald Mercury</p>
<p>New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;</p>
<p>A combination and a form indeed,</p>
<p>Where every god did seem to set his seal,</p>
<p>To give the world assurance of a man:</p>
<p>This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:</p>
<p>Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,</p>
<p>Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?</p>
<p>Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,</p>
<p>And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?</p>
<p>You cannot call it love; for at your age</p>
<p>The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,</p>
<p>And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment</p>
<p>Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,</p>
<p>Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense</p>
<p>Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,</p>
<p>Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd</p>
<p>But it reserved some quantity of choice,</p>
<p>To serve in such a difference. What devil was't</p>
<p>That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?</p>
<p>Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,</p>
<p>Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,</p>
<p>Or but a sickly part of one true sense</p>
<p>Could not so mope.</p>
<p>O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,</p>
<p>If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,</p>
<p>To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,</p>
<p>And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame</p>
<p>When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,</p>
<p>Since frost itself as actively doth burn</p>
<p>And reason panders will.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>O Hamlet, speak no more:</p>
<p>Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;</p>
<p>And there I see such black and grained spots</p>
<p>As will not leave their tinct.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Nay, but to live</p>
<p>In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,</p>
<p>Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love</p>
<p>Over the nasty sty,--</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>O, speak to me no more;</p>
<p>These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;</p>
<p>No more, sweet Hamlet!</p>



HAMLET
<p>A murderer and a villain;</p>
<p>A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe</p>
<p>Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;</p>
<p>A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,</p>
<p>That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,</p>
<p>And put it in his pocket!</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>No more!</p>



HAMLET
<p>A king of shreds and patches,--</p>

<p>Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,</p>
<p>You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Alas, he's mad!</p>



HAMLET
<p>Do you not come your tardy son to chide,</p>
<p>That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by</p>
<p>The important acting of your dread command? O, say!</p>



Ghost
<p>Do not forget: this visitation</p>
<p>Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.</p>
<p>But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:</p>
<p>O, step between her and her fighting soul:</p>
<p>Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:</p>
<p>Speak to her, Hamlet.</p>



HAMLET
<p>How is it with you, lady?</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Alas, how is't with you,</p>
<p>That you do bend your eye on vacancy</p>
<p>And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?</p>
<p>Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;</p>
<p>And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,</p>
<p>Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,</p>
<p>Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,</p>
<p>Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper</p>
<p>Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?</p>



HAMLET
<p>On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!</p>
<p>His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,</p>
<p>Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;</p>
<p>Lest with this piteous action you convert</p>
<p>My stern effects: then what I have to do</p>
<p>Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>To whom do you speak this?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Do you see nothing there?</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Nor did you nothing hear?</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>No, nothing but ourselves.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!</p>
<p>My father, in his habit as he lived!</p>
<p>Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!</p>





QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>This the very coinage of your brain:</p>
<p>This bodiless creation ecstasy</p>
<p>Is very cunning in.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Ecstasy!</p>
<p>My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,</p>
<p>And makes as healthful music: it is not madness</p>
<p>That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,</p>
<p>And I the matter will re-word; which madness</p>
<p>Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,</p>
<p>Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,</p>
<p>That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:</p>
<p>It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,</p>
<p>Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,</p>
<p>Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;</p>
<p>Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;</p>
<p>And do not spread the compost on the weeds,</p>
<p>To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;</p>
<p>For in the fatness of these pursy times</p>
<p>Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,</p>
<p>Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.</p>



HAMLET
<p>O, throw away the worser part of it,</p>
<p>And live the purer with the other half.</p>
<p>Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;</p>
<p>Assume a virtue, if you have it not.</p>
<p>That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,</p>
<p>Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,</p>
<p>That to the use of actions fair and good</p>
<p>He likewise gives a frock or livery,</p>
<p>That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,</p>
<p>And that shall lend a kind of easiness</p>
<p>To the next abstinence: the next more easy;</p>
<p>For use almost can change the stamp of nature,</p>
<p>And either ... the devil, or throw him out</p>
<p>With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:</p>
<p>And when you are desirous to be bless'd,</p>
<p>I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,</p>

<p>I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,</p>
<p>To punish me with this and this with me,</p>
<p>That I must be their scourge and minister.</p>
<p>I will bestow him, and will answer well</p>
<p>The death I gave him. So, again, good night.</p>
<p>I must be cruel, only to be kind:</p>
<p>Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.</p>
<p>One word more, good lady.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>What shall I do?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:</p>
<p>Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;</p>
<p>Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;</p>
<p>And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,</p>
<p>Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,</p>
<p>Make you to ravel all this matter out,</p>
<p>That I essentially am not in madness,</p>
<p>But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;</p>
<p>For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,</p>
<p>Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,</p>
<p>Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?</p>
<p>No, in despite of sense and secrecy,</p>
<p>Unpeg the basket on the house's top.</p>
<p>Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,</p>
<p>To try conclusions, in the basket creep,</p>
<p>And break your own neck down.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,</p>
<p>And breath of life, I have no life to breathe</p>
<p>What thou hast said to me.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I must to England; you know that?</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Alack,</p>
<p>I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.</p>



HAMLET
<p>There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,</p>
<p>Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,</p>
<p>They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,</p>
<p>And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;</p>
<p>For 'tis the sport to have the engineer</p>
<p>Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard</p>
<p>But I will delve one yard below their mines,</p>
<p>And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,</p>
<p>When in one line two crafts directly meet.</p>
<p>This man shall set me packing:</p>
<p>I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.</p>
<p>Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor</p>
<p>Is now most still, most secret and most grave,</p>
<p>Who was in life a foolish prating knave.</p>
<p>Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.</p>
<p>Good night, mother.</p>





<h2>ACT IV</h2>

<h3>SCENE I.  A room in the castle.</h3>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:</p>
<p>You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.</p>
<p>Where is your son?</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Bestow this place on us a little while.</p>

<p>Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend</p>
<p>Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,</p>
<p>Behind the arras hearing something stir,</p>
<p>Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'</p>
<p>And, in this brainish apprehension, kills</p>
<p>The unseen good old man.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>O heavy deed!</p>
<p>It had been so with us, had we been there:</p>
<p>His liberty is full of threats to all;</p>
<p>To you yourself, to us, to every one.</p>
<p>Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?</p>
<p>It will be laid to us, whose providence</p>
<p>Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,</p>
<p>This mad young man: but so much was our love,</p>
<p>We would not understand what was most fit;</p>
<p>But, like the owner of a foul disease,</p>
<p>To keep it from divulging, let it feed</p>
<p>Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:</p>
<p>O'er whom his very madness, like some ore</p>
<p>Among a mineral of metals base,</p>
<p>Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>O Gertrude, come away!</p>
<p>The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,</p>
<p>But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed</p>
<p>We must, with all our majesty and skill,</p>
<p>Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!</p>

<p>Friends both, go join you with some further aid:</p>
<p>Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,</p>
<p>And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:</p>
<p>Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body</p>
<p>Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.</p>

<p>Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;</p>
<p>And let them know, both what we mean to do,</p>
<p>And what's untimely done...</p>
<p>Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,</p>
<p>As level as the cannon to his blank,</p>
<p>Transports his poison'd shot, may miss our name,</p>
<p>And hit the woundless air. O, come away!</p>
<p>My soul is full of discord and dismay.</p>





<h3>SCENE II.  Another room in the castle.</h3>



HAMLET
<p>Safely stowed.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
GUILDENSTERN
<p>Within  Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!</p>



HAMLET
<p>What noise? who calls on Hamlet?</p>
<p>O, here they come.</p>





ROSENCRANTZ
<p>What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence</p>
<p>And bear it to the chapel.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Do not believe it.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Believe what?</p>



HAMLET
<p>That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.</p>
<p>Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what</p>
<p>replication should be made by the son of a king?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Take you me for a sponge, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his</p>
<p>rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the</p>
<p>king best service in the end: he keeps them, like</p>
<p>an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to</p>
<p>be last swallowed: when he needs what you have</p>
<p>gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you</p>
<p>shall be dry again.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>I understand you not, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a</p>
<p>foolish ear.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go</p>
<p>with us to the king.</p>



HAMLET
<p>The body is with the king, but the king is not with</p>
<p>the body. The king is a thing--</p>



GUILDENSTERN
<p>A thing, my lord!</p>



HAMLET
<p>Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.</p>





<h3>SCENE III.  Another room in the castle.</h3>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.</p>
<p>How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!</p>
<p>Yet must not we put the strong law on him:</p>
<p>He's loved of the distracted multitude,</p>
<p>Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;</p>
<p>And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,</p>
<p>But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,</p>
<p>This sudden sending him away must seem</p>
<p>Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown</p>
<p>By desperate appliance are relieved,</p>
<p>Or not at all.</p>

<p>How now! what hath befall'n?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,</p>
<p>We cannot get from him.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>But where is he?</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Bring him before us.</p>



ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.</p>





KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?</p>



HAMLET
<p>At supper.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>At supper! where?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain</p>
<p>convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your</p>
<p>worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all</p>
<p>creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for</p>
<p>maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but</p>
<p>variable service, two dishes, but to one table:</p>
<p>that's the end.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Alas, alas!</p>



HAMLET
<p>A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a</p>
<p>king, and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>What dost you mean by this?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Nothing but to show you how a king may go a</p>
<p>progress through the guts of a beggar.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Where is Polonius?</p>



HAMLET
<p>In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger</p>
<p>find him not there, seek him i' the other place</p>
<p>yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within</p>
<p>this month, you shall nose him as you go up the</p>
<p>stairs into the lobby.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Go seek him there.</p>





HAMLET
<p>He will stay till ye come.</p>





KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--</p>
<p>Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve</p>
<p>For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence</p>
<p>With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;</p>
<p>The bark is ready, and the wind at help,</p>
<p>The associates tend, and every thing is bent</p>
<p>For England.</p>



HAMLET
<p>For England!</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Ay, Hamlet.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Good.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for</p>
<p>England! Farewell, dear mother.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Thy loving father, Hamlet.</p>



HAMLET
<p>My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man</p>
<p>and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!</p>





KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;</p>
<p>Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:</p>
<p>Away! for every thing is seal'd and done</p>
<p>That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.</p>

<p>And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--</p>
<p>As my great power thereof may give thee sense,</p>
<p>Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red</p>
<p>After the Danish sword, and thy free awe</p>
<p>Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set</p>
<p>Our sovereign process; which imports at full,</p>
<p>By letters congruing to that effect,</p>
<p>The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;</p>
<p>For like the hectic in my blood he rages,</p>
<p>And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,</p>
<p>Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.</p>





<h3>SCENE IV.  A plain in Denmark.</h3>



PRINCE FORTINBRAS
<p>Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;</p>
<p>Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras</p>
<p>Craves the conveyance of a promised march</p>
<p>Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.</p>
<p>If that his majesty would aught with us,</p>
<p>We shall express our duty in his eye;</p>
<p>And let him know so.</p>



Captain
<p>I will do't, my lord.</p>



PRINCE FORTINBRAS
<p>Go softly on.</p>






HAMLET
<p>Good sir, whose powers are these?</p>



Captain
<p>They are of Norway, sir.</p>



HAMLET
<p>How purposed, sir, I pray you?</p>



Captain
<p>Against some part of Poland.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Who commands them, sir?</p>



Captain
<p>The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,</p>
<p>Or for some frontier?</p>



Captain
<p>Truly to speak, and with no addition,</p>
<p>We go to gain a little patch of ground</p>
<p>That hath in it no profit but the name.</p>
<p>To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;</p>
<p>Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole</p>
<p>A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Why, then the Polack never will defend it.</p>



Captain
<p>Yes, it is already garrison'd.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats</p>
<p>Will not debate the question of this straw:</p>
<p>This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,</p>
<p>That inward breaks, and shows no cause without</p>
<p>Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.</p>



Captain
<p>God be wi' you, sir.</p>





ROSENCRANTZ
<p>Wilt please you go, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>I'll be with you straight go a little before.</p>

<p>How all occasions do inform against me,</p>
<p>And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,</p>
<p>If his chief good and market of his time</p>
<p>Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.</p>
<p>Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,</p>
<p>Looking before and after, gave us not</p>
<p>That capability and god-like reason</p>
<p>To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be</p>
<p>Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple</p>
<p>Of thinking too precisely on the event,</p>
<p>A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom</p>
<p>And ever three parts coward, I do not know</p>
<p>Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'</p>
<p>Sith I have cause and will and strength and means</p>
<p>To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:</p>
<p>Witness this army of such mass and charge</p>
<p>Led by a delicate and tender prince,</p>
<p>Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd</p>
<p>Makes mouths at the invisible event,</p>
<p>Exposing what is mortal and unsure</p>
<p>To all that fortune, death and danger dare,</p>
<p>Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great</p>
<p>Is not to stir without great argument,</p>
<p>But greatly to find quarrel in a straw</p>
<p>When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,</p>
<p>That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,</p>
<p>Excitements of my reason and my blood,</p>
<p>And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see</p>
<p>The imminent death of twenty thousand men,</p>
<p>That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,</p>
<p>Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot</p>
<p>Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,</p>
<p>Which is not tomb enough and continent</p>
<p>To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,</p>
<p>My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!</p>





<h3>SCENE V.  Elsinore. A room in the castle.</h3>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>I will not speak with her.</p>



Gentleman
<p>She is importunate, indeed distract:</p>
<p>Her mood will needs be pitied.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>What would she have?</p>



Gentleman
<p>She speaks much of her father; says she hears</p>
<p>There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;</p>
<p>Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,</p>
<p>That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,</p>
<p>Yet the unshaped use of it doth move</p>
<p>The hearers to collection; they aim at it,</p>
<p>And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;</p>
<p>Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures</p>
<p>yield them,</p>
<p>Indeed would make one think there might be thought,</p>
<p>Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.</p>



HORATIO
<p>'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew</p>
<p>Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Let her come in.</p>

<p>To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,</p>
<p>Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:</p>
<p>So full of artless jealousy is guilt,</p>
<p>It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.</p>





OPHELIA
<p>Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>How now, Ophelia!</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Sings</p>
<p>How should I your true love know</p>
<p>From another one?</p>
<p>By his cockle hat and staff,</p>
<p>And his sandal shoon.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Say you? nay, pray you, mark.</p>

<p>He is dead and gone, lady,</p>
<p>He is dead and gone;</p>
<p>At his head a grass-green turf,</p>
<p>At his heels a stone.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Nay, but, Ophelia,--</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Pray you, mark.</p>

<p>White his shroud as the mountain snow,--</p>





QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Alas, look here, my lord.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Sings</p>
<p>Larded with sweet flowers</p>
<p>Which bewept to the grave did go</p>
<p>With true-love showers.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>How do you, pretty lady?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's</p>
<p>daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not</p>
<p>what we may be. God be at your table!</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Conceit upon her father.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they</p>
<p>ask you what it means, say you this:</p>

<p>To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,</p>
<p>All in the morning betime,</p>
<p>And I a maid at your window,</p>
<p>To be your Valentine.</p>
<p>Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,</p>
<p>And dupp'd the chamber-door;</p>
<p>Let in the maid, that out a maid</p>
<p>Never departed more.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Pretty Ophelia!</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:</p>

<p>By Gis and by Saint Charity,</p>
<p>Alack, and fie for shame!</p>
<p>Young men will do't, if they come to't;</p>
<p>By cock, they are to blame.</p>
<p>Quoth she, before you tumbled me,</p>
<p>You promised me to wed.</p>
<p>So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,</p>
<p>An thou hadst not come to my bed.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>How long hath she been thus?</p>



OPHELIA
<p>I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I</p>
<p>cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him</p>
<p>i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:</p>
<p>and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my</p>
<p>coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;</p>
<p>good night, good night.</p>





KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Follow her close; give her good watch,</p>
<p>I pray you.</p>

<p>O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs</p>
<p>All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,</p>
<p>When sorrows come, they come not single spies</p>
<p>But in battalions. First, her father slain:</p>
<p>Next, your son gone; and he most violent author</p>
<p>Of his own just remove: the people muddied,</p>
<p>Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,</p>
<p>For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,</p>
<p>In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia</p>
<p>Divided from herself and her fair judgment,</p>
<p>Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:</p>
<p>Last, and as much containing as all these,</p>
<p>Her brother is in secret come from France;</p>
<p>Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,</p>
<p>And wants not buzzers to infect his ear</p>
<p>With pestilent speeches of his father's death;</p>
<p>Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,</p>
<p>Will nothing stick our person to arraign</p>
<p>In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,</p>
<p>Like to a murdering-piece, in many places</p>
<p>Gives me superfluous death.</p>





QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Alack, what noise is this?</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.</p>

<p>What is the matter?</p>



Gentleman
<p>Save yourself, my lord:</p>
<p>The ocean, overpeering of his list,</p>
<p>Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste</p>
<p>Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,</p>
<p>O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;</p>
<p>And, as the world were now but to begin,</p>
<p>Antiquity forgot, custom not known,</p>
<p>The ratifiers and props of every word,</p>
<p>They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'</p>
<p>Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:</p>
<p>'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!</p>
<p>O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>The doors are broke.</p>






LAERTES
<p>Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.</p>



Danes
<p>No, let's come in.</p>



LAERTES
<p>I pray you, give me leave.</p>



Danes
<p>We will, we will.</p>





LAERTES
<p>I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,</p>
<p>Give me my father!</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Calmly, good Laertes.</p>



LAERTES
<p>That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,</p>
<p>Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot</p>
<p>Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow</p>
<p>Of my true mother.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>What is the cause, Laertes,</p>
<p>That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?</p>
<p>Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:</p>
<p>There's such divinity doth hedge a king,</p>
<p>That treason can but peep to what it would,</p>
<p>Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,</p>
<p>Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.</p>
<p>Speak, man.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Where is my father?</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Dead.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>But not by him.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Let him demand his fill.</p>



LAERTES
<p>How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:</p>
<p>To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!</p>
<p>Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!</p>
<p>I dare damnation. To this point I stand,</p>
<p>That both the worlds I give to negligence,</p>
<p>Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged</p>
<p>Most thoroughly for my father.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Who shall stay you?</p>



LAERTES
<p>My will, not all the world:</p>
<p>And for my means, I'll husband them so well,</p>
<p>They shall go far with little.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Good Laertes,</p>
<p>If you desire to know the certainty</p>
<p>Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,</p>
<p>That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,</p>
<p>Winner and loser?</p>



LAERTES
<p>None but his enemies.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Will you know them then?</p>



LAERTES
<p>To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;</p>
<p>And like the kind life-rendering pelican,</p>
<p>Repast them with my blood.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Why, now you speak</p>
<p>Like a good child and a true gentleman.</p>
<p>That I am guiltless of your father's death,</p>
<p>And am most sensible in grief for it,</p>
<p>It shall as level to your judgment pierce</p>
<p>As day does to your eye.</p>



Danes
<p>Within                Let her come in.</p>



LAERTES
<p>How now! what noise is that?</p>

<p>O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,</p>
<p>Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!</p>
<p>By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,</p>
<p>Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!</p>
<p>Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!</p>
<p>O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits</p>
<p>Should be as moral as an old man's life?</p>
<p>Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,</p>
<p>It sends some precious instance of itself</p>
<p>After the thing it loves.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Sings</p>
<p>They bore him barefaced on the bier;</p>
<p>Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;</p>
<p>And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--</p>
<p>Fare you well, my dove!</p>



LAERTES
<p>Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,</p>
<p>It could not move thus.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Sings</p>
<p>You must sing a-down a-down,</p>
<p>An you call him a-down-a.</p>
<p>O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false</p>
<p>steward, that stole his master's daughter.</p>



LAERTES
<p>This nothing's more than matter.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,</p>
<p>love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.</p>



LAERTES
<p>A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue</p>
<p>for you; and here's some for me: we may call it</p>
<p>herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with</p>
<p>a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you</p>
<p>some violets, but they withered all when my father</p>
<p>died: they say he made a good end,--</p>

<p>For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,</p>
<p>She turns to favour and to prettiness.</p>



OPHELIA
<p>Sings</p>
<p>And will he not come again?</p>
<p>And will he not come again?</p>
<p>No, no, he is dead:</p>
<p>Go to thy death-bed:</p>
<p>He never will come again.</p>
<p>His beard was as white as snow,</p>
<p>All flaxen was his poll:</p>
<p>He is gone, he is gone,</p>
<p>And we cast away moan:</p>
<p>God ha' mercy on his soul!</p>
<p>And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.</p>





LAERTES
<p>Do you see this, O God?</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Laertes, I must commune with your grief,</p>
<p>Or you deny me right. Go but apart,</p>
<p>Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.</p>
<p>And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:</p>
<p>If by direct or by collateral hand</p>
<p>They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,</p>
<p>Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,</p>
<p>To you in satisfaction; but if not,</p>
<p>Be you content to lend your patience to us,</p>
<p>And we shall jointly labour with your soul</p>
<p>To give it due content.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Let this be so;</p>
<p>His means of death, his obscure funeral--</p>
<p>No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,</p>
<p>No noble rite nor formal ostentation--</p>
<p>Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,</p>
<p>That I must call't in question.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>So you shall;</p>
<p>And where the offence is let the great axe fall.</p>
<p>I pray you, go with me.</p>





<h3>SCENE VI.  Another room in the castle.</h3>



HORATIO
<p>What are they that would speak with me?</p>



Servant
<p>Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Let them come in.</p>

<p>I do not know from what part of the world</p>
<p>I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.</p>





First Sailor
<p>God bless you, sir.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Let him bless thee too.</p>



First Sailor
<p>He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for</p>
<p>you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was</p>
<p>bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am</p>
<p>let to know it is.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Reads  'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked</p>
<p>this, give these fellows some means to the king:</p>
<p>they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old</p>
<p>at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us</p>
<p>chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on</p>
<p>a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded</p>
<p>them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so</p>
<p>I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with</p>
<p>me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they</p>
<p>did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king</p>
<p>have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me</p>
<p>with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I</p>
<p>have words to speak in thine ear will make thee</p>
<p>dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of</p>
<p>the matter. These good fellows will bring thee</p>
<p>where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their</p>
<p>course for England: of them I have much to tell</p>
<p>thee. Farewell.</p>
<p>'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'</p>
<p>Come, I will make you way for these your letters;</p>
<p>And do't the speedier, that you may direct me</p>
<p>To him from whom you brought them.</p>





<h3>SCENE VII.  Another room in the castle.</h3>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,</p>
<p>And you must put me in your heart for friend,</p>
<p>Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,</p>
<p>That he which hath your noble father slain</p>
<p>Pursued my life.</p>



LAERTES
<p>It well appears: but tell me</p>
<p>Why you proceeded not against these feats,</p>
<p>So crimeful and so capital in nature,</p>
<p>As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,</p>
<p>You mainly were stirr'd up.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>O, for two special reasons;</p>
<p>Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,</p>
<p>But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother</p>
<p>Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--</p>
<p>My virtue or my plague, be it either which--</p>
<p>She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,</p>
<p>That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,</p>
<p>I could not but by her. The other motive,</p>
<p>Why to a public count I might not go,</p>
<p>Is the great love the general gender bear him;</p>
<p>Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,</p>
<p>Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,</p>
<p>Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,</p>
<p>Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,</p>
<p>Would have reverted to my bow again,</p>
<p>And not where I had aim'd them.</p>



LAERTES
<p>And so have I a noble father lost;</p>
<p>A sister driven into desperate terms,</p>
<p>Whose worth, if praises may go back again,</p>
<p>Stood challenger on mount of all the age</p>
<p>For her perfections: but my revenge will come.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think</p>
<p>That we are made of stuff so flat and dull</p>
<p>That we can let our beard be shook with danger</p>
<p>And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:</p>
<p>I loved your father, and we love ourself;</p>
<p>And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--</p>

<p>How now! what news?</p>



Messenger
<p>Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:</p>
<p>This to your majesty; this to the queen.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>From Hamlet! who brought them?</p>



Messenger
<p>Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:</p>
<p>They were given me by Claudio; he received them</p>
<p>Of him that brought them.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.</p>


<p>'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on</p>
<p>your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see</p>
<p>your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your</p>
<p>pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden</p>
<p>and more strange return.                  'HAMLET.'</p>
<p>What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?</p>
<p>Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?</p>



LAERTES
<p>Know you the hand?</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!</p>
<p>And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'</p>
<p>Can you advise me?</p>



LAERTES
<p>I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;</p>
<p>It warms the very sickness in my heart,</p>
<p>That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,</p>
<p>'Thus didest thou.'</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>If it be so, Laertes--</p>
<p>As how should it be so? how otherwise?--</p>
<p>Will you be ruled by me?</p>



LAERTES
<p>Ay, my lord;</p>
<p>So you will not o'errule me to a peace.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,</p>
<p>As checking at his voyage, and that he means</p>
<p>No more to undertake it, I will work him</p>
<p>To an exploit, now ripe in my device,</p>
<p>Under the which he shall not choose but fall:</p>
<p>And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,</p>
<p>But even his mother shall uncharge the practise</p>
<p>And call it accident.</p>



LAERTES
<p>My lord, I will be ruled;</p>
<p>The rather, if you could devise it so</p>
<p>That I might be the organ.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>It falls right.</p>
<p>You have been talk'd of since your travel much,</p>
<p>And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality</p>
<p>Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts</p>
<p>Did not together pluck such envy from him</p>
<p>As did that one, and that, in my regard,</p>
<p>Of the unworthiest siege.</p>



LAERTES
<p>What part is that, my lord?</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>A very riband in the cap of youth,</p>
<p>Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes</p>
<p>The light and careless livery that it wears</p>
<p>Than settled age his sables and his weeds,</p>
<p>Importing health and graveness. Two months since,</p>
<p>Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--</p>
<p>I've seen myself, and served against, the French,</p>
<p>And they can well on horseback: but this gallant</p>
<p>Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;</p>
<p>And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,</p>
<p>As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured</p>
<p>With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,</p>
<p>That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,</p>
<p>Come short of what he did.</p>



LAERTES
<p>A Norman was't?</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>A Norman.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Upon my life, Lamond.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>The very same.</p>



LAERTES
<p>I know him well: he is the brooch indeed</p>
<p>And gem of all the nation.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>He made confession of you,</p>
<p>And gave you such a masterly report</p>
<p>For art and exercise in your defence</p>
<p>And for your rapier most especially,</p>
<p>That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,</p>
<p>If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,</p>
<p>He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,</p>
<p>If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his</p>
<p>Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy</p>
<p>That he could nothing do but wish and beg</p>
<p>Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.</p>
<p>Now, out of this,--</p>



LAERTES
<p>What out of this, my lord?</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Laertes, was your father dear to you?</p>
<p>Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,</p>
<p>A face without a heart?</p>



LAERTES
<p>Why ask you this?</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Not that I think you did not love your father;</p>
<p>But that I know love is begun by time;</p>
<p>And that I see, in passages of proof,</p>
<p>Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.</p>
<p>There lives within the very flame of love</p>
<p>A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;</p>
<p>And nothing is at a like goodness still;</p>
<p>For goodness, growing to a plurisy,</p>
<p>Dies in his own too much: that we would do</p>
<p>We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes</p>
<p>And hath abatements and delays as many</p>
<p>As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;</p>
<p>And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,</p>
<p>That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--</p>
<p>Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,</p>
<p>To show yourself your father's son in deed</p>
<p>More than in words?</p>



LAERTES
<p>To cut his throat i' the church.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;</p>
<p>Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,</p>
<p>Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.</p>
<p>Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:</p>
<p>We'll put on those shall praise your excellence</p>
<p>And set a double varnish on the fame</p>
<p>The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together</p>
<p>And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,</p>
<p>Most generous and free from all contriving,</p>
<p>Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,</p>
<p>Or with a little shuffling, you may choose</p>
<p>A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise</p>
<p>Requite him for your father.</p>



LAERTES
<p>I will do't:</p>
<p>And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.</p>
<p>I bought an unction of a mountebank,</p>
<p>So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,</p>
<p>Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,</p>
<p>Collected from all simples that have virtue</p>
<p>Under the moon, can save the thing from death</p>
<p>That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point</p>
<p>With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,</p>
<p>It may be death.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Let's further think of this;</p>
<p>Weigh what convenience both of time and means</p>
<p>May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,</p>
<p>And that our drift look through our bad performance,</p>
<p>'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project</p>
<p>Should have a back or second, that might hold,</p>
<p>If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:</p>
<p>We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.</p>
<p>When in your motion you are hot and dry--</p>
<p>As make your bouts more violent to that end--</p>
<p>And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him</p>
<p>A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,</p>
<p>If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,</p>
<p>Our purpose may hold there.</p>

<p>How now, sweet queen!</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>One woe doth tread upon another's heel,</p>
<p>So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Drown'd! O, where?</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>There is a willow grows aslant a brook,</p>
<p>That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;</p>
<p>There with fantastic garlands did she come</p>
<p>Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples</p>
<p>That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,</p>
<p>But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:</p>
<p>There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds</p>
<p>Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;</p>
<p>When down her weedy trophies and herself</p>
<p>Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;</p>
<p>And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:</p>
<p>Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;</p>
<p>As one incapable of her own distress,</p>
<p>Or like a creature native and indued</p>
<p>Unto that element: but long it could not be</p>
<p>Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,</p>
<p>Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay</p>
<p>To muddy death.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Alas, then, she is drown'd?</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Drown'd, drown'd.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,</p>
<p>And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet</p>
<p>It is our trick; nature her custom holds,</p>
<p>Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,</p>
<p>The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:</p>
<p>I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,</p>
<p>But that this folly douts it.</p>





KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Let's follow, Gertrude:</p>
<p>How much I had to do to calm his rage!</p>
<p>Now fear I this will give it start again;</p>
<p>Therefore let's follow.</p>





<h2>ACT V</h2>

<h3>SCENE I.  A churchyard.</h3>



First Clown
<p>Is she to be buried in Christian burial that</p>
<p>wilfully seeks her own salvation?</p>



Second Clown
<p>I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave</p>
<p>straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it</p>
<p>Christian burial.</p>



First Clown
<p>How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her</p>
<p>own defence?</p>



Second Clown
<p>Why, 'tis found so.</p>



First Clown
<p>It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For</p>
<p>here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,</p>
<p>it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it</p>
<p>is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned</p>
<p>herself wittingly.</p>



Second Clown
<p>Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--</p>



First Clown
<p>Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here</p>
<p>stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,</p>
<p>and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he</p>
<p>goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him</p>
<p>and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he</p>
<p>that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.</p>



Second Clown
<p>But is this law?</p>



First Clown
<p>Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.</p>



Second Clown
<p>Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been</p>
<p>a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'</p>
<p>Christian burial.</p>



First Clown
<p>Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that</p>
<p>great folk should have countenance in this world to</p>
<p>drown or hang themselves, more than their even</p>
<p>Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient</p>
<p>gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:</p>
<p>they hold up Adam's profession.</p>



Second Clown
<p>Was he a gentleman?</p>



First Clown
<p>He was the first that ever bore arms.</p>



Second Clown
<p>Why, he had none.</p>



First Clown
<p>What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the</p>
<p>Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'</p>
<p>could he dig without arms? I'll put another</p>
<p>question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the</p>
<p>purpose, confess thyself--</p>



Second Clown
<p>Go to.</p>



First Clown
<p>What is he that builds stronger than either the</p>
<p>mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?</p>



Second Clown
<p>The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a</p>
<p>thousand tenants.</p>



First Clown
<p>I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows</p>
<p>does well; but how does it well? it does well to</p>
<p>those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the</p>
<p>gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,</p>
<p>the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.</p>



Second Clown
<p>'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or</p>
<p>a carpenter?'</p>



First Clown
<p>Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.</p>



Second Clown
<p>Marry, now I can tell.</p>



First Clown
<p>To't.</p>



Second Clown
<p>Mass, I cannot tell.</p>





First Clown
<p>Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull</p>
<p>ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when</p>
<p>you are asked this question next, say 'a</p>
<p>grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till</p>
<p>doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a</p>
<p>stoup of liquor.</p>


<p>In youth, when I did love, did love,</p>
<p>Methought it was very sweet,</p>
<p>To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,</p>
<p>O, methought, there was nothing meet.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he</p>
<p>sings at grave-making?</p>



HORATIO
<p>Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.</p>



HAMLET
<p>'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath</p>
<p>the daintier sense.</p>



First Clown
<p>Sings</p>
<p>But age, with his stealing steps,</p>
<p>Hath claw'd me in his clutch,</p>
<p>And hath shipped me intil the land,</p>
<p>As if I had never been such.</p>





HAMLET
<p>That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:</p>
<p>how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were</p>
<p>Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It</p>
<p>might be the pate of a politician, which this ass</p>
<p>now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,</p>
<p>might it not?</p>



HORATIO
<p>It might, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,</p>
<p>sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might</p>
<p>be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord</p>
<p>such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?</p>



HORATIO
<p>Ay, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and</p>
<p>knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:</p>
<p>here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to</p>
<p>see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,</p>
<p>but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.</p>



First Clown

<p>A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,</p>
<p>For and a shrouding sheet:</p>
<p>O, a pit of clay for to be made</p>
<p>For such a guest is meet.</p>





HAMLET
<p>There's another: why may not that be the skull of a</p>
<p>lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,</p>
<p>his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he</p>
<p>suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the</p>
<p>sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of</p>
<p>his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be</p>
<p>in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,</p>
<p>his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,</p>
<p>his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and</p>
<p>the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine</p>
<p>pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him</p>
<p>no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than</p>
<p>the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The</p>
<p>very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in</p>
<p>this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?</p>



HORATIO
<p>Not a jot more, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Is not parchment made of sheepskins?</p>



HORATIO
<p>Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.</p>



HAMLET
<p>They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance</p>
<p>in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose</p>
<p>grave's this, sirrah?</p>



First Clown
<p>Mine, sir.</p>

<p>O, a pit of clay for to be made</p>
<p>For such a guest is meet.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.</p>



First Clown
<p>You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not</p>
<p>yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.</p>



HAMLET
<p>'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:</p>
<p>'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.</p>



First Clown
<p>'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to</p>
<p>you.</p>



HAMLET
<p>What man dost thou dig it for?</p>



First Clown
<p>For no man, sir.</p>



HAMLET
<p>What woman, then?</p>



First Clown
<p>For none, neither.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Who is to be buried in't?</p>



First Clown
<p>One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.</p>



HAMLET
<p>How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the</p>
<p>card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,</p>
<p>Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of</p>
<p>it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the</p>
<p>peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he</p>
<p>gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a</p>
<p>grave-maker?</p>



First Clown
<p>Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day</p>
<p>that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.</p>



HAMLET
<p>How long is that since?</p>



First Clown
<p>Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it</p>
<p>was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that</p>
<p>is mad, and sent into England.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?</p>



First Clown
<p>Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits</p>
<p>there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Why?</p>



First Clown
<p>'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men</p>
<p>are as mad as he.</p>



HAMLET
<p>How came he mad?</p>



First Clown
<p>Very strangely, they say.</p>



HAMLET
<p>How strangely?</p>



First Clown
<p>Faith, e'en with losing his wits.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Upon what ground?</p>



First Clown
<p>Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man</p>
<p>and boy, thirty years.</p>



HAMLET
<p>How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?</p>



First Clown
<p>I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we</p>
<p>have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce</p>
<p>hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year</p>
<p>or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Why he more than another?</p>



First Clown
<p>Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that</p>
<p>he will keep out water a great while; and your water</p>
<p>is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.</p>
<p>Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth</p>
<p>three and twenty years.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Whose was it?</p>



First Clown
<p>A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Nay, I know not.</p>



First Clown
<p>A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a</p>
<p>flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,</p>
<p>sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.</p>



HAMLET
<p>This?</p>



First Clown
<p>E'en that.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Let me see.</p>

<p>Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow</p>
<p>of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath</p>
<p>borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how</p>
<p>abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at</p>
<p>it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know</p>
<p>not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your</p>
<p>gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,</p>
<p>that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one</p>
<p>now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?</p>
<p>Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let</p>
<p>her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must</p>
<p>come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell</p>
<p>me one thing.</p>



HORATIO
<p>What's that, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'</p>
<p>the earth?</p>



HORATIO
<p>E'en so.</p>



HAMLET
<p>And smelt so? pah!</p>





HORATIO
<p>E'en so, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may</p>
<p>not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,</p>
<p>till he find it stopping a bung-hole?</p>



HORATIO
<p>'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.</p>



HAMLET
<p>No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with</p>
<p>modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as</p>
<p>thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,</p>
<p>Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of</p>
<p>earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he</p>
<p>was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?</p>
<p>Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,</p>
<p>Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:</p>
<p>O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,</p>
<p>Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!</p>
<p>But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.</p>

<p>The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?</p>
<p>And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken</p>
<p>The corse they follow did with desperate hand</p>
<p>Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.</p>
<p>Couch we awhile, and mark.</p>





LAERTES
<p>What ceremony else?</p>



HAMLET
<p>That is Laertes,</p>
<p>A very noble youth: mark.</p>



LAERTES
<p>What ceremony else?</p>



First Priest
<p>Her obsequies have been as far enlarged</p>
<p>As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;</p>
<p>And, but that great command o'ersways the order,</p>
<p>She should in ground unsanctified have lodged</p>
<p>Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,</p>
<p>Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;</p>
<p>Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,</p>
<p>Her maiden strewments and the bringing home</p>
<p>Of bell and burial.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Must there no more be done?</p>



First Priest
<p>No more be done:</p>
<p>We should profane the service of the dead</p>
<p>To sing a requiem and such rest to her</p>
<p>As to peace-parted souls.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Lay her i' the earth:</p>
<p>And from her fair and unpolluted flesh</p>
<p>May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,</p>
<p>A ministering angel shall my sister be,</p>
<p>When thou liest howling.</p>



HAMLET
<p>What, the fair Ophelia!</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Sweets to the sweet: farewell!</p>

<p>I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;</p>
<p>I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,</p>
<p>And not have strew'd thy grave.</p>



LAERTES
<p>O, treble woe</p>
<p>Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,</p>
<p>Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense</p>
<p>Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,</p>
<p>Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:</p>

<p>Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,</p>
<p>Till of this flat a mountain you have made,</p>
<p>To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head</p>
<p>Of blue Olympus.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Advancing     What is he whose grief</p>
<p>Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow</p>
<p>Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand</p>
<p>Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,</p>
<p>Hamlet the Dane.</p>





LAERTES
<p>The devil take thy soul!</p>





HAMLET
<p>Thou pray'st not well.</p>
<p>I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;</p>
<p>For, though I am not splenitive and rash,</p>
<p>Yet have I something in me dangerous,</p>
<p>Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Pluck them asunder.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Hamlet, Hamlet!</p>



All
<p>Gentlemen,--</p>



HORATIO
<p>Good my lord, be quiet.</p>





HAMLET
<p>Why I will fight with him upon this theme</p>
<p>Until my eyelids will no longer wag.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>O my son, what theme?</p>



HAMLET
<p>I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers</p>
<p>Could not, with all their quantity of love,</p>
<p>Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>O, he is mad, Laertes.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>For love of God, forbear him.</p>



HAMLET
<p>'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:</p>
<p>Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?</p>
<p>Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?</p>
<p>I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?</p>
<p>To outface me with leaping in her grave?</p>
<p>Be buried quick with her, and so will I:</p>
<p>And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw</p>
<p>Millions of acres on us, till our ground,</p>
<p>Singeing his pate against the burning zone,</p>
<p>Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,</p>
<p>I'll rant as well as thou.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>This is mere madness:</p>
<p>And thus awhile the fit will work on him;</p>
<p>Anon, as patient as the female dove,</p>
<p>When that her golden couplets are disclosed,</p>
<p>His silence will sit drooping.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Hear you, sir;</p>
<p>What is the reason that you use me thus?</p>
<p>I loved you ever: but it is no matter;</p>
<p>Let Hercules himself do what he may,</p>
<p>The cat will mew and dog will have his day.</p>





KING CLAUDIUS
<p>I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.</p>


<p>Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;</p>
<p>We'll put the matter to the present push.</p>
<p>Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.</p>
<p>This grave shall have a living monument:</p>
<p>An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;</p>
<p>Till then, in patience our proceeding be.</p>





<h3>SCENE II.  A hall in the castle.</h3>



HAMLET
<p>So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;</p>
<p>You do remember all the circumstance?</p>



HORATIO
<p>Remember it, my lord?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,</p>
<p>That would not let me sleep: methought I lay</p>
<p>Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,</p>
<p>And praised be rashness for it, let us know,</p>
<p>Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,</p>
<p>When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us</p>
<p>There's a divinity that shapes our ends,</p>
<p>Rough-hew them how we will,--</p>



HORATIO
<p>That is most certain.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Up from my cabin,</p>
<p>My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark</p>
<p>Groped I to find out them; had my desire.</p>
<p>Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew</p>
<p>To mine own room again; making so bold,</p>
<p>My fears forgetting manners, to unseal</p>
<p>Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--</p>
<p>O royal knavery!--an exact command,</p>
<p>Larded with many several sorts of reasons</p>
<p>Importing Denmark's health and England's too,</p>
<p>With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,</p>
<p>That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,</p>
<p>No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,</p>
<p>My head should be struck off.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Is't possible?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.</p>
<p>But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?</p>



HORATIO
<p>I beseech you.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--</p>
<p>Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,</p>
<p>They had begun the play--I sat me down,</p>
<p>Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:</p>
<p>I once did hold it, as our statists do,</p>
<p>A baseness to write fair and labour'd much</p>
<p>How to forget that learning, but, sir, now</p>
<p>It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know</p>
<p>The effect of what I wrote?</p>



HORATIO
<p>Ay, good my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>An earnest conjuration from the king,</p>
<p>As England was his faithful tributary,</p>
<p>As love between them like the palm might flourish,</p>
<p>As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear</p>
<p>And stand a comma 'tween their amities,</p>
<p>And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,</p>
<p>That, on the view and knowing of these contents,</p>
<p>Without debatement further, more or less,</p>
<p>He should the bearers put to sudden death,</p>
<p>Not shriving-time allow'd.</p>



HORATIO
<p>How was this seal'd?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.</p>
<p>I had my father's signet in my purse,</p>
<p>Which was the model of that Danish seal;</p>
<p>Folded the writ up in form of the other,</p>
<p>Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,</p>
<p>The changeling never known. Now, the next day</p>
<p>Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent</p>
<p>Thou know'st already.</p>



HORATIO
<p>So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Why, man, they did make love to this employment;</p>
<p>They are not near my conscience; their defeat</p>
<p>Does by their own insinuation grow:</p>
<p>'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes</p>
<p>Between the pass and fell incensed points</p>
<p>Of mighty opposites.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Why, what a king is this!</p>



HAMLET
<p>Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--</p>
<p>He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,</p>
<p>Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,</p>
<p>Thrown out his angle for my proper life,</p>
<p>And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,</p>
<p>To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,</p>
<p>To let this canker of our nature come</p>
<p>In further evil?</p>



HORATIO
<p>It must be shortly known to him from England</p>
<p>What is the issue of the business there.</p>



HAMLET
<p>It will be short: the interim is mine;</p>
<p>And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'</p>
<p>But I am very sorry, good Horatio,</p>
<p>That to Laertes I forgot myself;</p>
<p>For, by the image of my cause, I see</p>
<p>The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.</p>
<p>But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me</p>
<p>Into a towering passion.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Peace! who comes here?</p>





OSRIC
<p>Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?</p>



HORATIO
<p>No, my good lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to</p>
<p>know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a</p>
<p>beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at</p>
<p>the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,</p>
<p>spacious in the possession of dirt.</p>



OSRIC
<p>Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I</p>
<p>should impart a thing to you from his majesty.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of</p>
<p>spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.</p>



OSRIC
<p>I thank your lordship, it is very hot.</p>



HAMLET
<p>No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is</p>
<p>northerly.</p>



OSRIC
<p>It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.</p>



HAMLET
<p>But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my</p>
<p>complexion.</p>



OSRIC
<p>Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as</p>
<p>'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his</p>
<p>majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a</p>
<p>great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--</p>



HAMLET
<p>I beseech you, remember--</p>





OSRIC
<p>Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.</p>
<p>Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe</p>
<p>me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent</p>
<p>differences, of very soft society and great showing:</p>
<p>indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or</p>
<p>calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the</p>
<p>continent of what part a gentleman would see.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;</p>
<p>though, I know, to divide him inventorially would</p>
<p>dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw</p>
<p>neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the</p>
<p>verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of</p>
<p>great article; and his infusion of such dearth and</p>
<p>rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his</p>
<p>semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace</p>
<p>him, his umbrage, nothing more.</p>



OSRIC
<p>Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.</p>



HAMLET
<p>The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman</p>
<p>in our more rawer breath?</p>



OSRIC
<p>Sir?</p>



HORATIO
<p>Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?</p>
<p>You will do't, sir, really.</p>



HAMLET
<p>What imports the nomination of this gentleman?</p>



OSRIC
<p>Of Laertes?</p>



HORATIO
<p>His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Of him, sir.</p>



OSRIC
<p>I know you are not ignorant--</p>



HAMLET
<p>I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,</p>
<p>it would not much approve me. Well, sir?</p>



OSRIC
<p>You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--</p>



HAMLET
<p>I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with</p>
<p>him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to</p>
<p>know himself.</p>



OSRIC
<p>I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation</p>
<p>laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.</p>



HAMLET
<p>What's his weapon?</p>



OSRIC
<p>Rapier and dagger.</p>



HAMLET
<p>That's two of his weapons: but, well.</p>



OSRIC
<p>The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary</p>
<p>horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take</p>
<p>it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their</p>
<p>assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the</p>
<p>carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very</p>
<p>responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,</p>
<p>and of very liberal conceit.</p>



HAMLET
<p>What call you the carriages?</p>



HORATIO
<p>I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.</p>



OSRIC
<p>The carriages, sir, are the hangers.</p>



HAMLET
<p>The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we</p>
<p>could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might</p>
<p>be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses</p>
<p>against six French swords, their assigns, and three</p>
<p>liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet</p>
<p>against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?</p>



OSRIC
<p>The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes</p>
<p>between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you</p>
<p>three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it</p>
<p>would come to immediate trial, if your lordship</p>
<p>would vouchsafe the answer.</p>



HAMLET
<p>How if I answer 'no'?</p>



OSRIC
<p>I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his</p>
<p>majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let</p>
<p>the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the</p>
<p>king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;</p>
<p>if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.</p>



OSRIC
<p>Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?</p>



HAMLET
<p>To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.</p>



OSRIC
<p>I commend my duty to your lordship.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Yours, yours.</p>

<p>He does well to commend it himself; there are no</p>
<p>tongues else for's turn.</p>



HORATIO
<p>This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.</p>



HAMLET
<p>He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.</p>
<p>Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I</p>
<p>know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of</p>
<p>the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of</p>
<p>yesty collection, which carries them through and</p>
<p>through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do</p>
<p>but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.</p>





Lord
<p>My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young</p>
<p>Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in</p>
<p>the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to</p>
<p>play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's</p>
<p>pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now</p>
<p>or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.</p>



Lord
<p>The king and queen and all are coming down.</p>



HAMLET
<p>In happy time.</p>



Lord
<p>The queen desires you to use some gentle</p>
<p>entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.</p>



HAMLET
<p>She well instructs me.</p>





HORATIO
<p>You will lose this wager, my lord.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I do not think so: since he went into France, I</p>
<p>have been in continual practise: I shall win at the</p>
<p>odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here</p>
<p>about my heart: but it is no matter.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Nay, good my lord,--</p>



HAMLET
<p>It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of</p>
<p>gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.</p>



HORATIO
<p>If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will</p>
<p>forestall their repair hither, and say you are not</p>
<p>fit.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special</p>
<p>providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,</p>
<p>'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be</p>
<p>now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the</p>
<p>readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he</p>
<p>leaves, what is't to leave betimes?</p>





KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.</p>





HAMLET
<p>Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;</p>
<p>But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.</p>
<p>This presence knows,</p>
<p>And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd</p>
<p>With sore distraction. What I have done,</p>
<p>That might your nature, honour and exception</p>
<p>Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.</p>
<p>Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:</p>
<p>If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,</p>
<p>And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,</p>
<p>Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.</p>
<p>Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,</p>
<p>Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;</p>
<p>His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.</p>
<p>Sir, in this audience,</p>
<p>Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil</p>
<p>Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,</p>
<p>That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,</p>
<p>And hurt my brother.</p>



LAERTES
<p>I am satisfied in nature,</p>
<p>Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most</p>
<p>To my revenge: but in my terms of honour</p>
<p>I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,</p>
<p>Till by some elder masters, of known honour,</p>
<p>I have a voice and precedent of peace,</p>
<p>To keep my name ungored. But till that time,</p>
<p>I do receive your offer'd love like love,</p>
<p>And will not wrong it.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I embrace it freely;</p>
<p>And will this brother's wager frankly play.</p>
<p>Give us the foils. Come on.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Come, one for me.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance</p>
<p>Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,</p>
<p>Stick fiery off indeed.</p>



LAERTES
<p>You mock me, sir.</p>



HAMLET
<p>No, by this hand.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,</p>
<p>You know the wager?</p>



HAMLET
<p>Very well, my lord</p>
<p>Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>I do not fear it; I have seen you both:</p>
<p>But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.</p>



LAERTES
<p>This is too heavy, let me see another.</p>



HAMLET
<p>This likes me well. These foils have all a length?</p>





OSRIC
<p>Ay, my good lord.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.</p>
<p>If Hamlet give the first or second hit,</p>
<p>Or quit in answer of the third exchange,</p>
<p>Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:</p>
<p>The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;</p>
<p>And in the cup an union shall he throw,</p>
<p>Richer than that which four successive kings</p>
<p>In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;</p>
<p>And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,</p>
<p>The trumpet to the cannoneer without,</p>
<p>The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,</p>
<p>'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:</p>
<p>And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Come on, sir.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Come, my lord.</p>





HAMLET
<p>One.</p>



LAERTES
<p>No.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Judgment.</p>



OSRIC
<p>A hit, a very palpable hit.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Well; again.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;</p>
<p>Here's to thy health.</p>

<p>Give him the cup.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.</p>

<p>Another hit; what say you?</p>



LAERTES
<p>A touch, a touch, I do confess.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Our son shall win.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>He's fat, and scant of breath.</p>
<p>Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;</p>
<p>The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Good madam!</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Gertrude, do not drink.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Aside  It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.</p>



HAMLET
<p>I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>Come, let me wipe thy face.</p>



LAERTES
<p>My lord, I'll hit him now.</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>I do not think't.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Aside  And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;</p>
<p>I pray you, pass with your best violence;</p>
<p>I am afeard you make a wanton of me.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Say you so? come on.</p>





OSRIC
<p>Nothing, neither way.</p>



LAERTES
<p>Have at you now!</p>





KING CLAUDIUS
<p>Part them; they are incensed.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Nay, come, again.</p>





OSRIC
<p>Look to the queen there, ho!</p>



HORATIO
<p>They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?</p>



OSRIC
<p>How is't, Laertes?</p>



LAERTES
<p>Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;</p>
<p>I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.</p>



HAMLET
<p>How does the queen?</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>She swounds to see them bleed.</p>



QUEEN GERTRUDE
<p>No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--</p>
<p>The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.</p>





HAMLET
<p>O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:</p>
<p>Treachery! Seek it out.</p>



LAERTES
<p>It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;</p>
<p>No medicine in the world can do thee good;</p>
<p>In thee there is not half an hour of life;</p>
<p>The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,</p>
<p>Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise</p>
<p>Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,</p>
<p>Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:</p>
<p>I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.</p>



HAMLET
<p>The point!--envenom'd too!</p>
<p>Then, venom, to thy work.</p>





All
<p>Treason! treason!</p>



KING CLAUDIUS
<p>O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.</p>



HAMLET
<p>Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,</p>
<p>Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?</p>
<p>Follow my mother.</p>





LAERTES
<p>He is justly served;</p>
<p>It is a poison temper'd by himself.</p>
<p>Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:</p>
<p>Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,</p>
<p>Nor thine on me.</p>





HAMLET
<p>Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.</p>
<p>I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!</p>
<p>You that look pale and tremble at this chance,</p>
<p>That are but mutes or audience to this act,</p>
<p>Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,</p>
<p>Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--</p>
<p>But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;</p>
<p>Thou livest; report me and my cause aright</p>
<p>To the unsatisfied.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Never believe it:</p>
<p>I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:</p>
<p>Here's yet some liquor left.</p>



HAMLET
<p>As thou'rt a man,</p>
<p>Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.</p>
<p>O good Horatio, what a wounded name,</p>
<p>Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!</p>
<p>If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart</p>
<p>Absent thee from felicity awhile,</p>
<p>And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,</p>
<p>To tell my story.</p>

<p>What warlike noise is this?</p>



OSRIC
<p>Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,</p>
<p>To the ambassadors of England gives</p>
<p>This warlike volley.</p>



HAMLET
<p>O, I die, Horatio;</p>
<p>The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:</p>
<p>I cannot live to hear the news from England;</p>
<p>But I do prophesy the election lights</p>
<p>On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;</p>
<p>So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,</p>
<p>Which have solicited. The rest is silence.</p>





HORATIO
<p>Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:</p>
<p>And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!</p>
<p>Why does the drum come hither?</p>






PRINCE FORTINBRAS
<p>Where is this sight?</p>



HORATIO
<p>What is it ye would see?</p>
<p>If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.</p>



PRINCE FORTINBRAS
<p>This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,</p>
<p>What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,</p>
<p>That thou so many princes at a shot</p>
<p>So bloodily hast struck?</p>



First Ambassador
<p>The sight is dismal;</p>
<p>And our affairs from England come too late:</p>
<p>The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,</p>
<p>To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,</p>
<p>That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:</p>
<p>Where should we have our thanks?</p>



HORATIO
<p>Not from his mouth,</p>
<p>Had it the ability of life to thank you:</p>
<p>He never gave commandment for their death.</p>
<p>But since, so jump upon this bloody question,</p>
<p>You from the Polack wars, and you from England,</p>
<p>Are here arrived give order that these bodies</p>
<p>High on a stage be placed to the view;</p>
<p>And let me speak to the yet unknowing world</p>
<p>How these things came about: so shall you hear</p>
<p>Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,</p>
<p>Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,</p>
<p>Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,</p>
<p>And, in this upshot, purposes mistook</p>
<p>Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I</p>
<p>Truly deliver.</p>



PRINCE FORTINBRAS
<p>Let us haste to hear it,</p>
<p>And call the noblest to the audience.</p>
<p>For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:</p>
<p>I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,</p>
<p>Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.</p>



HORATIO
<p>Of that I shall have also cause to speak,</p>
<p>And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;</p>
<p>But let this same be presently perform'd,</p>
<p>Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance</p>
<p>On plots and errors, happen.</p>



PRINCE FORTINBRAS
<p>Let four captains</p>
<p>Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;</p>
<p>For he was likely, had he been put on,</p>
<p>To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,</p>
<p>The soldiers' music and the rites of war</p>
<p>Speak loudly for him.</p>
<p>Take up the bodies: such a sight as this</p>
<p>Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.</p>
<p>Go, bid the soldiers shoot.</p>
